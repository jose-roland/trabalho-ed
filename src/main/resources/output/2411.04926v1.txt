Abstract: We compute the surface charges associated to p−form gauge fields in
arbitrary spacetime dimension for large values of the radial coordinate. In the critical
dimension where radiation and Coulomb falloff coincide we find asymptotic charges
involving asymptotic parameters, i.e. parameters with a component of order zero in the
radial coordinate. However, in different dimensions we still find nontrivial asymptotic
charges now involving parameters that are not asymptotic times the radiation-order
fields. For p=1 and D > 4, our charges thus differ from those presented in the
literature. We then show that under Hodge duality “electric” charges for p−forms are
mapped to “magnetic” charges for the dual q−forms, with q = D− p− 2. For charges
involving fields with radiation falloffs the duality relates charges that are finite and
nonvanishing. For the case of Coulomb falloffs, above or below the critical dimension,
Hodge duality exchanges overleading charges in one theory with subleading ones in
its dual counterpart.

1 Introduction

Gauge theories involving p−form fields emerge naturally in many physical contexts.
In string theory, Dp−branes can be introduced as sources carrying the charge of
(p+ 1)−forms while p−form-type massive particles provide the simplest specimens of
the “exotic” part of the string spectrum containing mixed-symmetry representations of
SO(24) or SO(8). In supersymmetric and supergravity theories, irreducible multiplets
generically contain p−forms [1–3]. More recently, in the context of celestial holography,
a basis of conformal primary wave functions for these fields was constructed in [4].

The on-shell degrees of freedom of a p−form gauge field in dimension D are carried
by two equivalent irreducible representations of SO(D − 2), given by antisymmetric

– 1 –



SO(D− 2) tensors of rank p and D− p− 2, respectively. The corresponding covariant
field theories thus provide dual realizations of the same physical degrees of freedom,
while still being off-shell inequivalent in terms of the corresponding irreps of GL(D)

(see e.g. [5]). In particular, whereas the gauge groups of dual theories are generically
different, there could be in principle an interesting interplay between the corresponding
asymptotic charges given that the latter are evaluated on-shell. The simplest example
to this effect is provided by the infinitely-many asymptotic charges involving a massless
scalar field first proposed in D = 4 in [6], whose symmetry origin was later identified
in terms of the asymptotic charges of the corresponding dual two-form [7–9]. See
also [10, 11] for a Hamiltonian perspective on the same issue at both spatial and null
infinity, and e.g. [12–15] for general reviews on asymptotic symmetries from different
vantage points.

In this work we would like to investigate the correspondences between dual
charges at null infinity holding for p−forms and (D − p− 2)−forms for any p and in
any D, thus in particular generalising the interplay between electric and magnetic
asymptotic charges highlighted for Maxwell fields in D = 4 in [16]. For analogous
investigations on the gravitational side see [17]. We evaluate the surface charges on
field configurations displaying two types of falloffs,

φr ∼ O(r−
D−2
2 ), radiation falloffs, (1.1)

φC ∼ O(r−(D−p−2)), Coulomb falloffs, (1.2)

that are of special physical significance: the first ones bring about information related
to the radiation flux and display a universal scaling for any p, while the second ones
encode the asymptotic scaling of static fields generated by extended “electric” sources.
For any value of p these falloffs coincide in the “critical dimension”

Dc = 2p+ 2, (1.3)

while the radiation order is leading for D > Dc and subleading for D < Dc. Various
aspects of the asymptotic symmetry structure of p−forms in D = Dc were explored
in [18, 19].

We work in Lorenz gauge and look for parameters that keep as much as possible
(1.1) and (1.2), under the condition that their leading components still display an
arbitrary dependence on the angular coordinates. To this end, consistently with
previous results concerning p = 1, 2 [9, 20, 21] we admit a polyhomogeneous expansion
of the residual symmetry parameters whose first subleading term is proportional to
ln r. Such logarithmic contributions in their turn lead to a “mild” violation of the field
falloffs (1.1) or (1.2), although in pure-gauge sectors. Proceeding in this fashion we
construct two classes of charges, one involving field configurations at radiation order,
that we denote Qr

p, and one containing fields at Coulomb orders, QC
p , displaying the

falloffs
Qr

p ∼ O(r0) , QC
p ∼ O(r−(D−2p−2)) . (1.4)

– 2 –



We thus obtain in any D asymptotically finite charges Qr
p involving the radiation order.

Let us remark that these charges involve asymptotic parameters, i.e. parameters
possessing a component of order O(r0) in their radial expansion, only in the critical
dimension D = Dc. Differently, they involve components of the parameters that are
overleading w.r.t. O(r0) in D < Dc and subleading for D > Dc. For instance for the
p = 1 case of Maxwell fields our asymptotic charges in any D are of the form

Qr
1 =

∫
Su

dΩ ϵ(
D−4
2

)(xi)H
(D
2
)

ru . (1.5)

In the expression above H
(D
2
)

ru denotes the relevant coefficient of the Maxwell field

strength in Bondi coordinates at order O(r−
D
2 ), while ϵ(

D−4
2

)(xi) is the coefficient of the

parameter at order O(r−
D−4
2 ) that thus describes a sector of the gauge transformations

that diverges in D < 4 and dies off, as one approaches null infinity, for D > 4.
When taking into account the Coulomb branch for the field falloffs, instead, one

finds that the charges themselves QC
p are overleading if D < Dc and subleading if

D > Dc, while they coincide with those built out of radiation falloffs for D = Dc.
We then consider the dualities between charges obtained for a given p−form and

for the corresponding form of degree q = D − p − 2. We explicitly define the map
connecting the “electric” charges for a given form degree to the “magnetic” ones of
its dual counterpart via Hodge duality. Charges involving fields at the radiation
order result to be of O(r0) in both electric and magnetic incarnations, while the
Coulombic charges that are divergent in a given picture get mapped to subleading
charges in the dual picture, and viceversa. This latter observation indicates that for
a given p−form gauge field in D > Dc, although from the “electric” viewpoint the
leading order for the charges is the radiation one, there will exist anyway magnetic
charges that are overleading with respect to Qr

p, that can be obtained as the dual
charges of the subleading Coulomb charges of the dual form of degree q = D − p− 2.
Assuming that these charges can be consistently renormalised [22–24], their presence
suggests that the asymptotic symmetry group of a given theory in general needs to be
defined taking into account all possible physically equivalent formulations of the same
theory, in particular whenever the gauge groups turn out to be different in different
incarnations.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we compute the residual symmetries
of p−forms in Lorenz gauge, that we exploit in Section 3 to compute the corresponding
charges for fields at radiation and at Coulomb orders. In Section 4 we construct
our duality map for each of the two classes of charges and observe in particular
the appearance of overleading magnetic charges for any p, when D > Dc. In the
appendices we collect a few technical results. In particular in Appendix C we provide
the asymptotic analysis of the solution space and discuss the possibility to attach a
physical meaning to the logarithmic terms violating the standard falloff prescription.

2 Residual symmetries of p−forms in Lorenz gauge

2.1 Generalities
The Lagrangian of a p−form gauge field Bµ1···µp is [1]

L = −
√
|g|

2(p+ 1)!
Hµ1···µp+1H

µ1···µp+1 (2.1)

where
Hµ1···µp+1 = ∂[µ1Bµ2···µp+1] (2.2)

is the (p+ 1)−form field strength1. The equations of motion are

∂µ1Hµ1···µp+1 = 0. (2.3)

The Lagrangian (2.1) is invariant under

δBµ1···µp = ∂[µ1
ϵ
(p−1)
µ2···µp]

, (2.4)

where in order to identify the linearly independent gauge transformations one has to
take into account the existence of a chain of p gauge-for-gauge redundancies of the
form

δϵ(k)µ1···µk
= ∂[µ1

ϵ
(k−1)
µ2···µk]

, k = 0, . . . p− 1 . (2.5)

We introduce Bondi coordinates (u, r, xi) where u = t − r and xi is a set of D − 2

angular variables parameterizing the (D − 2)−dimensional unit sphere SD−2. The
Minkowski line element is

ds2 = −du2 − 2dudr + r2γijdx
idxj i, j = 1, . . . , D − 2; (2.6)

where γij is the metric on SD−2 while the nonvanishing Christoffel symbols are

Γi
jr = Γi

rj =
1

r
δij, Γu

ij = −Γr
ij = rγij, Γk

ij =
1

2
γkl(∂jγli + ∂iγjl − ∂lγij). (2.7)

In these coordinates tensor components carry one additional power of r for each
index taking values on the angular coordinates, when expressed in terms of their
Cartesian counterparts. We focus on two types of falloffs, namely radiation and
Coulomb falloffs. For a p−form in Minkowskian coordinates they are identified with
the following scalings in r of each field component [18]:

B ∼ O(r−
D−2
2 ) radiation falloffs, (2.8)

B ∼ O(r−(D−p−2)) Coulomb falloffs. (2.9)

1Here we denote with square brackets antisymmetrization of indices with no normalization factors
implied, e.g. Hµ1µ2µ3

= ∂µ1
Bµ2µ3

+ ∂µ3
Bµ1µ2

+ ∂µ2
Bµ3µ1

.

– 4 –



These falloffs coincide in the “critical” dimension Dc = 2p + 2, whereas radiation
falloffs are leading for D > Dc and subleading for D < Dc. We work in Lorenz gauge

∇αBαµ2···µp = 0 , (2.10)

so that the gauge fields and the residual parameters are to satisfy2

□Bµ1···µp = 0 ,

□ ϵµ1···µp−1 = 0 ,

∇αϵαµ2···µp−1 = 0 .

(2.11)

We would like to determine the gauge parameters that keep either (2.8) or (2.9),
while also retaining an arbitrary dependence on the angular coordinates at the
corresponding leading order. However, for p = 1, 2 in the Lorenz gauge (2.10) those
two requirements cannot be strictly satisfied simultaneously: in order to preserve
an arbitrary dependence on the angular coordinates at leading order one has to
expand the parameters polyhomogeneously in r, so as to include in particular a first
subleading term proportional to ln r. See Appendix B for a proof for p = 1, 2 in any
D. The latter, in its turn, will induce overleading terms compared to some of the field
falloffs (2.8) and (2.9). One can always interpret these violations as taking place in
pure gauge sectors of the theory, with no impact on observable quantities. In this work
we assume the same mechanism and interpretation to hold for any p. In Appendix C,
however, we take a different perspective and analyse the effect of allowing the same
logarithmic falloffs in the physical sector, as additional contributions to the radial
behaviour of the field strength that do not spoil anyway the finiteness of physical
quantities, like the energy flux through null infinity, thanks to cancellations holding
due to the equations of motion and to the Lorenz gauge.

2.2 Residual symmetries
Let us consider first the example of a spin-one gauge field. With respect to the
analysis in [21, 25], here we work in any D and not just even D. The radiation falloffs
in Bondi coordinates are

Bµ ∼

{
O

r−

D−2
2

)
if µ ∈ {r, u},

O
(
r−

D−4

)
if µ = i,

(2.12)

while for the parameter we assume, as anticipated, a polyhomogeneous expansion of
the general form

ϵ =
∑
l∈Z

ϵ(l)(u, xi) + ϵ̃(l)(u, xi) ln(r)

rl
. (2.13)

2In order to reach the conditions (2.11) one has to perform a nested chain of Lorenz-like gauge-
for-gauge fixings exploiting (2.5).

Where l ∈ Z for even D and l ∈ 1

Z for odd D. Inserting the expansion (2.13) in

the gauge transformation of (2.12) and asking that the log terms appear at the first
subleading order we get

∑

l≥D−3

ϵ(l)(u, xi) + ϵ̃(l)(u, xi) ln(r)

rl
, (2.14)

where the u−dependent subleading coefficient ϵ̃(
D−2
2

)(u, xi), instrumental to preserve
the angular dependence of the leading component of the parameter, gives rise to a
violation of the falloff for the component Bu at O

(
r−

(D−2)
2 ln(r)

)
. We discuss the

role of those logarithmic terms in Appendix B, where we also show that ϵ(
D−4
2

)(x)

and ϵ(
D−2
2

)(u, x) are arbitrary functions of their arguments. Barring the additional
considerations presented in Appendix C, in the text, we take the general attitude
that the corresponding falloff violations are pure large gauge transformations3.

If one considers Coulomb falloffs,

Bµ ∼

{
O
(
r−(D−3)

)
if µ ∈ {r, u},

O
(
r−(D−4)

)
if µ = i,

(2.15)

assuming again an expansion as in (2.13), one finds

ϵ =
ϵ(D−4)(xi)

rD−4
+

∑
l≥D−3

ϵ(l)(u, xi) + ϵ̃(l)(u, xi) ln(r)

rl
. (2.16)

Let us mention that in this case equations of motion and guage fixing do not suffice to
cancel out the logarithmic overleading terms in Hru that would appear upon assuming
physical logarithmic corrections to the first of (2.15). The corresponding contributions
would still be subleading in D > Dc but would be relevant for D < Dc, where the
Coulombic branch is the leading one. Thus, for this latter case it seems that the only
consistent option is to interpret them as pure gauge contributions.

For the two-form the radiation falloffs are

Bµν ∼

O

if µ, ν ∈ {i, j} .

(2.17)

We assume an expansion as in (2.13), with a vector parameter, and find, after some
algebra

considered in [26] and allow to construct hierarchies of overleading charges.

Where we took into account the conditions for the residual gauge symmetry

□ϵα = □ϵ = ∇µϵµ = 0. (2.19)

one gets

Let us also mention that for both radiation and Coulomb falloffs it is possible to show
that, in dimension D > Dc, possible overleading components in ϵj(x

i) can be set to
zero performing gauge-for-gauge fixings.

For a p−form the analysis is essentially the same with more options for the
angular indices,

Buri1i2···ip−2 , Bri1i2···ip−1 , Bui1i2···ip−1 , Bi1i2···ip , (2.23)

and a bit more algebraic manipulations required, and where the asymptotic expansions
of the various components of the field are given in (C.10). However, if we focus on
ϵi1···ip−1 , which is the parameter that eventually enters the asymptotic charge, in the
polyhomogeneous expansion

ϵi1···ip−1 =
∑
l∈Z

ϵ
(l)
i1···ip−1

(u, xi) + ϵ̃
(l)

(u, xi) ln(r)

rl
, (2.24)

the leading order is in general a linear function f(p,D) of p and D. As such, we can
determine its general form for both radiation and Coulombic falloffs making use of
the results found for p = 1, 2, finding

fr(p,D) =
D − (2p+ 2)

2
,

fC(p,D) = D − (2p+ 2).

3 Asymptotic charges

Following Noether’s second theorem [27] the charges take the form

Q =

∫
Σ

jµdΣµ =

∫
∂Σ

kµνdσµν , (3.1)

where in the case of interest for us we integrate over the sphere SD−2 at null infinity,
i.e. keeping u and r fixed, and then taking the limit r → +∞. From the variation of
the Lagrangian (2.1) one finds, up to factors

kµν = ϵρ1···ρp−1H
µνρ1···ρp−1 . (3.2)

In Bondi coordinates the integration measure in (3.1) brings about a factor of rD−2.
Thus, in order for the charges to have a finite and nonvanishing limit for r → ∞, one
needs

kµν ∼ O(r−(D−2)). (3.3)

For asymptotic parameters, i.e. parameters whose radial expansion is of the schematic
form

ϵ(u, r, xi) = ϵ(0)(xi) + subleading terms, (3.4)

at least for the relevant components of ϵ entering (3.1), the corresponding components
of the field strength are to satisfy H ∼ O(r−(D−2)). However, finite asymptotic
charges can also involve non-asymptotic parameters, as long as (3.3) holds.

In the following we will compute the formal charges that involve the leading
parameters found in the previous section for radiation and Coulomb falloffs, respec-
tively. For the case of radiation falloffs we always find finite asymptotic charges,
involving however full-fledged asymptotic parameters only in the critical dimension.
For the case of Coulomb falloffs in D ̸= Dc the corresponding charges are either
overleading, if D < Dc, or subleading, if D > Dc. As we shall see in Section 4 all
these charges turn out to be relevant in the discussion of dualities between p−forms
and q = (D − p− 2)−forms. In our writing of the charges we will consistently omit
overall factors.

3.1 1−forms
The asymptotic charge in the case of 1−forms is

Q1 = lim
r→+∞

∫
ϵHrur

D−2dΩ. (3.5)

For the case of radiation falloff we see from (2.14) that the leading order term of the
parameter scales like O(r

4−D
2 ), so that the leading contribution to the charge is given

by

Qr

r . (3.7)

The charge (3.6) is indeed asymptotic, i.e. of order O(r0). To make (3.7) more explicit,
following the analysis in [21], we can set B

(D−2
2

)
u to zero by exploiting the arbitrary

u−dependence of ϵ(
D−2
2

) (see the discussion below (B.4)). Note that this amounts to
a small gauge transformation because this component of the gauge parameter does
not appear in the asymptotic charge (3.6). Let us also note that the Lorenz gauge
condition combined with the r−equation of motion (see Eqs. (C.11) and (C.15) for
p = 1, without fields with tilde superscript) impose

∂uB

(3.8)

In view of the above conditions, for l = D
2
, combining the two equations imposes

r = 0, while the first one yields

∂uB
(D

r = ∇iB
(D−4

Substituting into (3.6), we finally obtain

Qr
1 = −

∫
ϵ(

D−4

)(xi)∇iB
(D−4

2
)

i (u, xi)dΩ, (3.10)

This result matches the one in footnote 4 of [21]. This charge is intrisically related to
the presence of radiation encoded in the field component B(D−4

2
)

i , which indeed is the
relevant one to calculate the energy flux through null infinity (see Eq. (3.11) of [21]).

For Coulomb fall-offs, given the radial behaviour of the parameter in (2.16), one
finds

QC

r→+∞

∫
ϵ(D−4)(xi)

rD−4

[
H(D−2)

ru + H̃(D−2)
ru ln(r)

]
dΩ. (3.11)

In this expression we also considered the possibility that the logarithmic terms in
the polyhomogeneous expansion (2.16) be associated to corresponding falloffs in the
physical sector of the theory, so that they are present in the radial expansion of
the field strength. Differently from the case of the energy flux for radiation falloffs,
discussed in Appendix C, we see that such terms would indeed affect the charge and
produce a leading Coulombic behaviour ∼ O(r−(D−4) ln r). From the equations of
motion and the gauge condition one finds

H(D−2)
ru = −(D − 3)B(D−3)

u − ∂uB

u − ∂uB̃
(D−2)
r = (D − 4)B̃(D−3)

u .
(3.12)

– 9 –



so that in particular, by the second of (3.12),one sees that the charge (3.11) is anyway
finite in the critical dimension D = 4. Differently, irrespective of the log terms, (3.11)
it vanishes in D > 4 and diverges in D < 4.

In what follows, however, we will still assume that the log terms only affect pure
gauge configurations, and as such do not alter the form of the charges, even for
the Coulomb branch of the field falloffs. Additional considerations on their possible
physical role will be proposed in Appendix C.

3.2 2−forms
In this case we need to evaluate

Q2 = lim
r→+∞

∫

(3.14)

For the case of radiation falloffs, the gauge parameter scales as in (2.18) and conse-
quently one can find an asymptotic charge given by

rj . (3.16)

The same kind of analysis performed for the one-form case can be repeated in this
setting and shows that (3.15) depends on the free radiation data. However, we
postpone the discussion to the general case of p−forms in the next paragraph.

Differently, for Coulomb falloffs the parameter in (2.22) to leading order scales
like O(r6−D) and thus the leading contribution to the corresponding charge is given
by

One can notice that in D = 4 the radiation charge (3.15) involves an overleading
parameter [9, 26]. The Coulombic charge (3.17) in its turn vanishes in D > 6 and
diverges in D < 6. In D = 6 (3.15) coincides with (3.15).

3.3 p−forms
The general case reproduces what seen above up to a somewhat heavier algebra.
Barring an overall factor the surface charge is given by

4 The duality map

Gauge fields described by p−forms and (D−p− 2)−forms provide independent irreps
of GL(D), whenever they both exist, associated to gauge symmetries that are also
independent. However, in force of their on-shell duality, one expects that any charge
computed in one theory should have a counterpart in the dual partner theory. The
true issue at stake is to explore whether Hodge-duality connecting asymptotic charges
allows one to highlight sectors of the asymptotic symmetry group of a theory that are
only visible, or more easily identified, from the dual perspective. The prototypical
instance of this phenomenon is provided by the dual pair (scalar field)-(two form) in
D = 4, where one can indeed construct asymptotic charges for the scalar theory but
it is only through Hodge duality that the connection to asymptotic symmetries can
be made apparent [7–10]. For the case of electromagnetism in D = 4 the same issue
was investigated in [16], while p−forms in the critical dimension in where considered
in [18, 19] and in AdSD in [28].

– 12 –



Our main goal in this section is to derive a duality map between p−form charges
and (D − p− 2)−form charges making use of the duality map connecting the corre-
sponding field strengths in different descriptions. We consider first the asymptotic
charges (3.21), displaying a well-defined and non-vanishing asymptotic limit in any D,
to then extend our considerations to the charges (3.28), for which the duality map will
relate vanishing (divergent) charges in one description to divergent (vanishing) charges
in its dual counterpart. The map that we implement in this work relates electric
charges in one setup to magnetic charges in its dual counterpart. An alternative
procedure, meant to define a map relating electric charges to electric charges will be
proposed in [29].

4.1 Duality map at radiation order
Let us consider first the case of the dual pair (1−form)-(2−form) in D = 5. The
charges involving the radiation order are

where the integral is over the 3−sphere at null infinity. We will refer to these charges
as the “electric” charges of the two theories. We aim to exploit the Hodge-duality
between the field strengths (we adopt the mostly-plus signature for the metric)

F = − ⋆ H,

H = ⋆F ,

to show that the one-form charge in (4.1) can be given a meaning as a charge in
the two-form theory, and viceversa. Although in this section we will be basically
concerned with the duality at the level of field strengths, let us observe that from
(4.3) one can also link the one-form leading order field components A

dual two-form leading order field components B

an angle dependent integration constant which can be fixed in such a way that A( 1

A natural dual map between the charges can be obtained exploiting (4.3) in the

integrands of (4.1). In particular, from the first of (4.3) one finds

γ, (4.6)

where we took into account that εlskεlsi = 2δki . One can verify that in the space of
asymptotic solution the components of the one-form field strength in (4.6) do not
vanish. Therefore, substituting (4.6) in the second of (4.1) we map the electric charge
for the two-form in a magnetic charge for the one-form corresponding to radiation
falloffs4:

where, here and in the following, the supersctript tilde is meant to identify magnetic
charges and where we interpret the vector parameter in (4.7) as the gauge parameter
of the two-form, magnetic photon5. In a similar fashion, one can derive a magnetic
charge for the two-form with radiation falloffs, Q̃r

photon by choosing for instance ϵ

(− 1

i (xi) = ϵ(−
1
2 )(xi)(1, 1, 1). However, this choice hides the nature

of the magnetic spin-one gauge symmetry in D = 5. In addition, in order to get the charge (4.7)
only using the electric part of the gauge symmetry (2.14), one should then extend that expansion to
also include an overleading term.

where q = D − 2− p. As before, the duality map can be derived starting from the
physical information of the duality between the field strengths

Hq = ⋆Hp,

Hp = (−)1+(p+1)(q+1) ⋆ Hq .
(4.10)

In particular, for the components involving only angular indexes they read

Hk1···kp+1

Again, looking at the Hodge dual equation with one index u and the remaining ones

and B

i1···iq be proportional.
We would like to employ (4.11) to trade the integrands in (4.9) for angular

components of the corresponding dual field strengths. One can see that the first of
(4.11) relates the order D−2p−2 on the l.h.s. with D−2q+2 on the r.h.s. . Making
use of this relation we can map the electric charge for the q−form to a magnetic
charge for the p−form:

i1···iD−p−3
(4.14)

plays the role of magnetic gauge parameter for the p−form. To obtain the magnetic
charge Q̃r

q, dual to Qr
p, it is enough to exchange p ↔ q in (4.13). Reinstalling overall

signs we have

Qr
p = Q̃r

q,

Qr
q = (−1)1+(p+1)(q+1)Q̃r

p.
(4.15)

Following [16], one can formally consider complexified charges

Qr
p := Qr

p + iQ̃r

Qr
q := Qr

q + iQ̃r

(4.16)

which, as in the case of electromagnetism in D = 4, generate a complexified uC(1)

symmetry algebra. Under duality these charges transform according to a Möbius
transformation parameterized by the matrix A ∈ PGL(2,C)

A =

[
0 1

(−1)1+(p+1)(q+1) 0

]
. (4.17)

According to the value of (−1)1+(p+1)(q+1)s, this transformation is a either a reflection
with respect the bisector of the first quadrant if (−1)1+(p+1)(q+1) = +1 or a rotation
of θ = ±π

2
, (clockwise on Qr

q and counterclockwise on Qr
p) if (−1)1+(p+1)(q+1) = −1.

4.2 Duality map at Coulomb order
For the charges (3.28) involving field components with Coulomb fall-offs one can
formally reproduce the same steps, with the proviso that one carefully takes into
account the different orders entering the charges.

The Coulombic magnetic charge in the p−form theory dual to QC
q is then given

by

Q̃C
p = lim

r→+∞

∫
εi1···iq−1j1···jp+1

i1···iq−1

r−(D−2p−2)
(xi)H

(D−(2p+2))
j1···jp+1

dΩ, (4.18)

This charge is divergent in D > 2p + 2 and vanishing in D < 2p + 2, which is
the opposite behavior with respect to the charges (3.28): when the Coulombic
electric charge (3.28) vanishes the corresponding magnetic charge (4.18) diverges,
and viceversa. Therefore a charge that in a given theory is subleading with respect
to the charge with radiation falloffs is mapped to an overleading charge in the dual
description. One simple instance is again the dual pair two-form and scalar feld in
D = 4. In that case the overleading O(r2) 2-form charge is mapped to a subleading
scalar charge of order O(r−2). Scalar charges acting at O(r−2) appear, for example,
in [30] in connection with the pion memory effect.

5 Outlook

Our asymptotic charges (3.26) at radiation order, based on non-asymptotic param-
eters, seemingly provide an alternative to the construction of charges based on
overleading parameters, i.e. parameters involving an O(r0) component in any D,
typically introduced as pure gauge cotributions in order to account for the existence
of asymptotic symmetries in D > 4 [25, 31–34]. In this respect it would be interesting
to understand to what kind of observables, if any, should those charges be related.
Their actual meaning indeed is not fully clear at a first glance, since on the one hand
they would be expected to generate large gauge transformations on I, but on the
other hand they would seemingly do so exploiting a gauge parameter that does not
get to null infinity!

– 16 –



An obvious generalization of our results would involve a similar exploration for
gauge fields of spin s ≥ 2. The most direct goal would be that of constructing a
new set of putative observable asymptotic quantitities. In addition, one would like
to explore the possibility that hidden sectors of the asymptotic symmetry group of
gravity in D > 4, or more generally of higher-spin fields, may be visible, or at least
better apparent, if explored form the perspective of the various dual formulations
admissible [35, 36].

B The necessity of logarithms for p = 1, 2

For the 1-form, let us consider the Lorenz gauge fixing preserving conditions (A.4)
and the ansatz (2.14). The recursion relations are trivially satisfied for l ≤ D−6

2
, and

for l = D−4
2

, we have
∂uϵ

(D−4
2

) = 0, (B.1)

which is obeyed since ϵ(
D−4
2

) only depends on the angles. Considering l = D−2
2

, we get
(the symbol k(p=1) is defined in (A.5))[

− k(p=1)

D − 2

)
+∆

]
ϵ(

D−4

) = 2∂uϵ̃
(D−2

If we suppressed the logarithmic terms, we would get[

D − 2

)
+∆

]
ϵ(

D−4
2

) = 0 ⇒ ϵ(
D−4

) = 0 . (B.3)

This mechanism, already discussed in [21] for the case of a one-form, would thus
trivialize the charges in (3.6). Instead, thanks to the presence of the logarithmic
series, (B.2) can be solved by

D−2
2

)(x) a u−independent integration function. Note that the first of (A.4)
indeed does not impose any additional constraint on ∂uϵ̃

(D−2
2

). The function ϵ(
D−2
2

)(u, x)

is instead completely free, and the remaining equations for l ≥ D
2

can be solved
recursively and expressed in terms of ϵ(

D−4
2

)(x), ϵ(
D−2
2

)(u, x) and of suitable integration
functions as discussed in Ref. [21]. This analysis establishes that the parameter (2.14)
indeed admits an arbitrary angular dependence in ϵ(

D−4
2

)(x) (in addition to the free
functionϵ(

D−2
2

)(u, x)).
In the same manner, for the 2-form, let us consider the Lorenz gauge fixing

preserving conditions (A.8) and the divergence free condition. Before proceeding on,
let us consider how to fix the gauge for gauge fixing (2.20). The conditions to fix the
gauge for gauge fixing are given by

ϵ̃
(D

)

u = −∂uϵ̃
(D
2
);

ϵ
(D−8

2
)

i = −∂iϵ
(D−8

2
);

ϵ̃
(D−6

2
)

i = −∂iϵ̃
(D−6

2
).

(B.5)

In order to impose these constraints we need to consider a 2-polyhomogeneous
expansion for the gauge for gauge parameter

ϵ =
∑
l∈ 1

2

ϵ(l)(u, xi) + ϵ̃(l)(u, xi) ln(r) + ˜̃ϵ(l)(u, xi) ln2(r)

(l) + 2˜̃ϵ(l−1) − 2∂uϵ̃

From equation (B.7a) with l = D−2

The gauge for gauge fixing equation fix for us the functions ϵ̃(

then equations (B.9c) and (B.9d) fix the functions ˜̃ϵ(

). Moreover,

– 20 –



considering equation (B.7b) for l ≤ D−6
2

we get that all the functions ϵ̃(l) with l ≤ D−8
2

are fixed. At this point, equations (B.10c), (B.10d), (B.10e) and (B.10f) together
to (B.7c) for l ≤ D−10

2
fix the functions ϵ(

However, from equations (B.9a), (B.9b), (B.10a) and (B.7b) we have the unfixed
functions ˜̃ϵ(

) to stop the chain of fixing
functions and be sure not to set gauge fixing with the same arbitrary functions.

After these considerations on the gauge fixing, we can proceed considering the
preserving Lorenz gauge condition for the 2-form. Starting from (A.8a), we consider
first l = D

2
getting [

ϵ̃

u = 0 ⇒ ϵ̃

u = 0; (B.11)

next, we consider l = D−2
2

to get[

]
ϵ̃
(D−4

u = 0 ⇒ ϵ̃
(D−4

u = 0; (B.12)

going on in this way we get

ϵ̃(l)u = 0 ∀l ≤ D

2
, (B.13)

where the equality rises from our gauge for gauge fixing. Now we take into account
equation (A.8b) and we consider respectively l = D−2

2
and l = D−4

u = 0 ⇒ ϵ

u = 0;

(B.14)

going on, we get

ϵ(l)u = 0 ∀l ≤ D − 4

, (B.15)

It is now the turn of (A.8c); let us start with l = D−2

ϵ̃

r = 0 ⇒ ϵ̃

r = 0; (B.16)

if we now consider equation (A.8c) with l = D−4
2

and equation (A.8e) with l = D−6
2

we get [

and using results from Appendix D we find that

ϵ̃
(D−6

r = ϵ̃

i = 0. (B.18)

Taking now equation (A.8c) with l = D−6
2

and equation (A.8e) with l = D−8
2

we get[

(B.19)

and using again results from Appendix D we find that

ϵ̃

r = ϵ̃

i = 0. (B.20)

Going on we get

ϵ̃(l)r = 0 ∀ l ≤ D − 4

2
;

ϵ̃
(l)
i = 0 ∀ l ≤ D − 6

2

(B.21)

where the equality in the second equation take into account our gauge for gauge fixing.
From the conditions that falloffs are preserved up to logarithmic terms one gets

∂uϵ
(l)
r = 0 ∀ l ≤ D − 4

2
,

∂uϵ
(l)
i = 0 ∀ l ≤ D − 6

2
.

(B.22)

Now, considering the first equation (A.11) with l = D−2
2

we get

∂uϵ̃
(D−2

2

r = 0. (B.23)

Let us consider equation (A.8d) with l = D−4

we have[

ϵ

r = 0 ⇒ ϵ

r = 0; (B.24)

considering, now equation (A.8d) with l = D−6
2

and equation (A.8f) with l = D−8
2

we
get [

r = ϵ

i = 0; (B.26)

– 22 –



Like the case of tilded functions above, we can go on using results of Appendix D;
therefore

ϵ(l)r = 0 ∀ l ≤ D − 6

2
;

ϵ
(l)
i = 0 ∀ l ≤ D − 8

2
.

(B.27)

The fifth and the seventh equation of the preserving fall-off condition up to logarithm
are now trivially solved.
Let us now show the necessity of logarithmic terms for the 2-form; considering equation
(A.8d) with l = D−2

2
and equation (A.8f) with l = D−4

2
we get, using constrain (B.23)[

(B.28)

and we would deduce that ϵ

)

r = ϵ
(D−6

2
)

i = 0 due to results in Appendix D if
logarithmic terms in the gauge parameter expansion would suppressed: the presence of
ϵ̃
(D−4

2
)

i is the lifesaver of asymptotic symmetry since it indirectly makes the asymptotic
charges non-zero.
The very same analysis, with minimal modification, can be retraced in the case of
Coulomb fall-offs leading to the same results.

C Asymptotic solution space and matter couplings

In our analysis of residual symmetries in Lorenz gauge we are forced to include
logarithmic falloffs on the gauge parameters. In the bulk of our presentation we
treated them as pure-large gauge transformations, that as such do not affect the large-
r behaviour of field-strength components. In this section we consider the possibility
that they do modify the falloffs of physical fields and analyse their consequences in
the presence of matter couplings, in the spirit of [24, 37].

Let us first consider the case of scalar QED. We assume that the scalar matter
displays the leading radial behaviour

ϕ ∼ ϕ(D−2
2

)

r
D−2
2

, (C.1)

so that the falloffs of the current Jµ = ieϕDµϕ are given by

Thus, the equations of motion in Lorenz gauge,

□Bµ = Jµ, (C.3)

– 23 –



can be solved as in Appendix A with the difference that the subleading orders satisfy
an equation with source. We consider the following polyhomogeneous expansions for
the gauge field

we get for l = D

r = 0. (C.6)

The relations (C.5) and (C.6) are instrumental to show in particular that the logs do
not modify the leading behaviour of the component Hru of the field strength, since

dangerous leading order logarithms in the field strength component Hrui1···ip−1 that
guarantees finiteness of the energy flux. In the case of a polyhomogeneous expansion
for the gauge field components with Coulomb fall-offs, equations (C.12) and (C.17)
are modified to

∂uB
(D−2p−1)
ri1···ip−1

= 0;

(D − 2p)
[
∂uB̃

(D−2p)
ri1···ip−1

D A useful result

Let us consider the following differential equation system

[−k1 +∆]f − 2∇ihi = 0; (D.1a)

[−k2 +∆]hi + 2∇if = 0; (D.1b)

where k1 and k2 are parametric positive numbers while f and hi sufficiently smooth
arbitrary functions. This kind of system is the one appearing in (B.17), (B.19), (B.25)
and, if logarithmic terms would suppressed, in (B.28).
Taking the gradient of equation (D.1b) we get

2∆f − k2∇ihi +∇i∇j∇jhi = 0; (D.2)

where, due to curvature effects, we cannot exchange covariant derivatives. However
using the Riemann tensor components identity [∇i,∇j]hi = ∇i∇jhi − ∇j∇ihi =

– 26 –



Rk
iijhk = gksRsiijhj we can go on. Indeed

(D.3)

but the Riemann tensor components for a maximally symmetric space are given by

Rαβγδ = gαγgβδ − gαδgβγ (D.4)

from which, using the metric of the (D − 2)−sphere γαβ we get

Rβδ = γαγRαβγδ = (D − 2)γβδ − δγδ γβγ = (D − 3)γβδ. (D.5)

Therefore
∇i∇j(∇jhi) = ∇j∇j∇ihi + (D − 3)∇ihi. (D.6)

Hence, returning to equation (D.2) we can write

2∆f + [∆ + (D − 3− k2)]∇ihi = 0; (D.7)

from which
∆f = −1

2
[∆ + k̄2]∇ihi, (D.8)

where we defined k̄2 := (D − 3 − k2). Now, inserting the expression for ∆f from
above in equation (D.1a) we get

−1

2
[∆ + k̄2]∇ihi = 2∇ihi + k1f ; (D.9)

from which

f = − [∆ + k̄2 + 4]

2k1
∇ihi, (D.10)

and reinserting it back in the original equation we have

− [−k1 +∆]
[∆ + k̄2 + 4]

2k1
∇ihi − 2∇ihi = 0 ⇒ [∆2 + (k̄2 − k1 + 4)∆− k1k̄2]∇ihi = 0. (D.11a)

However, in similar way, we can find from equation (D.1a)

∇ihi =
1

2
[−k1 +∆]f ; (D.12)

and substituting it in equation (D.2) to get

2∆f = −1

2
[∆ + k̄2][−k1 +∆]f ⇒ [∆2 + (k̄2 − k1 + 4)∆− k1k̄2]f = 0. (D.13)

– 27 –



Therefore functions ∇ihi and f satisfy the same differential equation; moreover the
full biharmonic equation on the ball under sufficiently smooth hypothesis of the
functions admits a unique solution. Therefore we conclude that

f = ∇ihi; (D.14)

and using this information in equation (D.1a) we have

[−k1 − 2 + ∆]f = 0 ⇒ f = 0, (D.15)

and using it in equation (D.1b) we get

[−k2 +∆]hi = 0 ⇒ hi = 0. (D.16)

In the steps above if k1 is null the equality (D.10) is not defined and an alternative
way is needed. We can start again form equation (D.8) and (D.1a) with k1 = 0 to get

[∆2 + (k̄2 + 4)∆]f = 0; (D.17)

while form the laplacian of (D.9) with k1 = 0 we get

[∆2 + (k̄2 + 4)∆]∇ihi = 0. (D.18)

Hence, again
f = ∇ihi, (D.19)

and from (D.1a) with k1 = 0 we deduce that

[−2 + ∆]f = 0 ⇒ f = 0, (D.20)

and using it in (D.1b) we get the same result in (D.16). If k2 = 0 it is enough to use
k̄2 = D − 3 in all steps.
