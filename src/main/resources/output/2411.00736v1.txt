Abstract

Despite the energetic significance of Lyman-alpha (Lyα; 1216Å) emis-
sion from solar flares, regular observations of flare related Lyα have been
relatively scarce until recently. Advances in instrumental capabilities and
a shift in focus over previous Solar Cycles mean it is now routinely possi-
ble to take regular co-observations of Lyα emission in solar flares. Thus, it
is valuable to examine how the instruments selected for flare observations
may influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis of their unique mea-
surements. Here, we examine three M-class flares each observed in Lyα
by GOES-14/EUVS-E, GOES-15/EUVS-E, or GOES-16/EXIS-EUVS-B,
and at least one other instrument from PROBA2/LYRA, MAVEN/EUVM,
ASO-S/LST-SDI, and SDO/EVE-MEGS-P. For each flare, the relative
and excess flux, contrast, total energy, and timings of the Lyα emission
were compared between instruments. It was found that while the discrep-
ancies in measurements of the relative flux between instruments may be
considered minimal, the calculated contrasts, excess fluxes, and energetics
may differ significantly - in some cases up to a factor of five. This may
have a notable impact on multi-instrument investigations of the variable
Lyα emission in solar flares and estimates of the contribution of Lyα to
the radiated energy budget of the chromosphere. The findings presented
in this study will act as a guide for the interpretation of observations of
flare-related Lyα from upcoming instruments during future Solar Cycles
and inform conclusions drawn from multi-instrument studies.

1 Introduction

The Lyman-alpha line of neutral hydrogen (Lyα; 1216Å) is the most intense
emission line in the quiescent solar spectrum [Curdt et al., 2001]. In spite of

this, observations of flare-related Lyα emission have historically been relatively
scarce. Among the earliest measurements of flare-related Lyα emission were
the spectroscopic observations of Skumanich et al. [1978] using the Laboratoire
de Physique Stellaire et Planetaire (LPSP; Bonnet et al. 1978) onboard Eighth
Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-8), and of Canfield and van Hoosier [1980]
using the NRL Spectrograph [Bartoe et al., 1977] within the Apollo Telescope
Mount onboard Skylab. However, due to the individual instrumental capabilities
required to observe such an energetic emission line on flare timescales, it has only
been possible in the last decade to conduct statistical studies using calibrated
photometric measurements of flare-related Lyα.

Milligan et al. [2020] conducted a large-scale statistical study of Lyα flares
observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)
during Solar Cycle 24. From their analysis of >500 M- and X-class flares, it was
found that both the energy and contrast in flare-related Lyα emission tend to
scale with Soft X-Ray (SXR) magnitude. Furthermore, it was found that 95%
of the flares sampled had an associated Lyα contrast of <10%. However, unique
cases could reach contrasts of up to ∼30%. Comparatively, observations of flare-
related Lyα from the Project for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA2; Santandrea
et al. 2013) have consistently found contrasts of < 1% (Kretzschmar et al.
2013, Raulin et al. 2013). One explanation for these notably low contrasts may
be significant detector degradation and the presence of contaminants in the
PROBA2 signal. Currently, the extent to which these discrepancies may exist
in co-observations between individual instruments is not well documented.

Lyα emission is optically thick and therefore observations in Lyα are subject
to effects of Centre-to-Limb Variation (CLV), whereby the position of a flare
on the solar disk (and the subsequent column depth along the observing line
of sight) can impact the measured Lyα irradiance (for further discussion see
Woods et al. 1995, Woods et al. 2006, Milligan 2021). The extent to which
CLV may impact Lyα observations was examined by Milligan et al. [2020] using
combined stereoscopic observations of an X1.1 flare from GOES-15 and the
Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN; Eparvier et al. 2015) in
orbit around Mars. For MAVEN, the flare was located close to disk-centre,
whereas for GOES the flare appeared at the solar limb. Subsequently, a ∼45%
increase in flare-related Lyα excess was observed at Mars relative to Earth,
thus demonstrating the magnitude of CLV on observations of optically-thick
emission.

Temporally, flare-related Lyα emission tends to peak in conjunction with
nonthermal Hard X-Ray (HXR) emission and therefore the derivative of the
SXRs in alignment with the Neupert Effect [Neupert, 1968]; examples of the
nonthermal origin of Lyα emission are demonstrated in Nusinov et al. [2006],
da Costa et al. [2009], Milligan et al. [2017], Dominique et al. [2018], Li et al.
[2022], Tian et al. [2023], and Greatorex et al. [2023]. In some instances, sec-
ondary Lyα emission peaks occur during the decay-phase, which is speculated
to originate from cooling loop plasma rather than the flare footpoint regions
[Kretzschmar et al., 2013], or from filament eruptions [Wauters et al., 2022].
However, systematic effects have also been shown to account for apparent viola-

2



tions of expected Neupertian behaviour. Milligan and Chamberlin [2016] found
flare-related Lyα emission observed by the Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Ex-
periment (EVE; Woods et al. 2012) onboard SDO to peak within the gradual
phase co-temporally with the associated Soft X-ray (SXR) emission. This was
later attributed to issues with the Kalman filters used during data processing
(D. Woodraska - Private Communication)

Recent instrumental advancements mean that it is now possible to image so-
lar flares in Lyα on sufficient timescales to observe the dynamic spatial develop-
ment of flare footpoints, loops, and ribbons. Li et al. [2022] studied a C1.4 flare
using observations from the Lyα channel of High Resolution Imager within the
Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard Solar Orbiter (SO/EUI-HRILyα; Müller
et al. 2020, Rochus et al. 20201). In their study, the authors found a co-spatial
relationship between Lyα emission and nonthermal HXR sources, similarity in
spatiotemporal behaviour between Lyα and He ii (304Å) emission observed by
the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Howard et al. 2008) onboard the Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead (STEREO-A; Kaiser et al. 2008) and
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO/AIA; Pesnell et al. 2012, Boerner et al. 2012), and Lyα brightenings in
both the rise and decay phase of the flare. Furthermore, the Solar Disk Im-
ager within the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope onboard the recently launched
Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S/SDI-LST; Li et al. 2019, Feng
et al. 2019, Gan et al. 2023, Chen et al. 2024) has been used to examine the
presence of long-period QPPs in an X6.4 solar flare, co-temporal with the associ-
ated HXR emission [Li et al., 2024]. Similar behaviour was presented by Milligan
et al. [2017] in a multi-instrument study using observations from GOES, SDO,
and the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin
et al. 2002).

Multi-instrument observations are crucial for examining fundamental open
questions surrounding the origin of flare-related emission, constraining the ra-
diated energy budget of the chromosphere, and the temporal evolution of flare-
related emission during different phases of solar flares. Using joint observations
from SDO, GOES, PROBA2, and RHESSI, Wauters et al. [2022] examined an
M6.7 flare with an additional peak in Lyα emission during the decay phase of
the flare that had no temporal correlation to the HXR or SXR emission. Using
images in 1600Å from SDO/AIA, the source of the emission was later attributed
to a failed filament eruption in proximity to the flare origin. Moreover, using
combined observations from RHESSI and GOES, both Milligan et al. [2014]
and Greatorex et al. [2023] were able to examine the contribution of Lyα to the
radiated energy budget of the chromosphere during solar flares. These studies
found for both an X- and M-class flare, Lyα may account for up to ∼8% of the
energy deposited into the chromosphere by nonthermal electrons.

When conducting precise analysis of solar flares, it is currently unclear to
what extent the instruments chosen for observations may impact the conclusions
drawn from their observations. This fact becomes more pertinent with the con-

sideration of newly-launched and upcoming missions such as ASO-S, GOES-R,
and Solar-C [Watanabe, 2014]. With the wealth of available data from current
missions, it is possible to thoroughly examine Lyα emission during solar flares.
This paper aims to assess the level of agreement in Lyα observations of solar
flares between different missions, focussing on observable metrics that may be
used to infer the underlying mechanisms driving the emission, such as the rela-
tive and excess fluxes, the flare contrasts, energetics, and timings. This analysis
should act as a guide for future studies using next generation instruments.

The instruments examined within this study are summarised in Section 2.
A discussion of the unique instrumental observing capabilities including the
spectral response functions and bandpasses is presented in Section 3. The flare
sample used for the individual case studies, as well as the calibration, standard-
isation, and analysis techniques are presented in Section 4. Section 5 details the
results of each case study. Finally, a discussion of the impact of this study and
future Lyα observation capabilities is presented in Section 6.

2 Instrumentation

This study focuses on the examination of observations of flare-related Lyα emis-
sion from multiple missions that have served the solar community over Solar
Cycle 24 and 25. The following section presents a brief summary of each in-
strument included in this study and details the individual calibration processes
carried out for each instrument where relevant. Table 1 contains a technical
summary of each instrument.

2.1 GOES-14/EUVS–E and GOES-15/EUVS–E

GOES-14 and GOES-15 both featured an X-Ray Sensor (XRS; Hanser and
Sellers 1996, Chamberlin et al. 2009) and Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS;
Viereck et al. 2007, Evans et al. 2010), observing disk-integrated SXR and Ex-
treme Ultraviolet (EUV) emission at a near 100% duty cycle. EUVS consisted
of five channels (A–E) covering the 50–170Å, 240–340Å, 200–620Å, 200–800Å,
and 1180–1250Å wavelength ranges. The E-channel (EUVS–E) was a dedicated
broadband channel centred around the Lyα line at 1216Å, observing the full
solar disk at 10.24s cadence. These GOES satellites operated in a geostationary
orbit at an altitude of approximately 36 000 km. Thus, observations from GOES
are subject to geocoronal absorption that are more pronounced around the
equinoxes. In this instance, EUV emission is absorbed by hydrogen in the geo-
corona, leading to a reduction in the observed emission. As a result, it is impor-
tant to consider Lyα observations where the effect of the geocorona is minimal
and/or can be accounted for. The GOES-14/EUVS-E and GOES-15/EUVS-E
observations suffer from degradation over time, which is compensated for by
using daily averages from the Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment
onboard the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE/SOLSTICE;
McClintock et al. 2005) to scale the daily averages from GOES. Thus, while the

4



degradation and absolute values are scaled to SORCE/SOLSTICE, the vari-
ability is determined by the GOES instrument. For this study, the degradation
corrected 1nm band (121-122nm) data were used.

2.2 GOES-16/EXIS–EUVS–B

GOES-16 operates with an incorporated set of SXR and EUV sensors as part
of a combined Extreme Ultraviolet and X-ray Irradiance Sensors (EXIS) suite.
The EUVS for EXIS is comprised of two channels (A and B) measuring the
spectral irradiance of lines within the 250–310Å and 1170–1410Å wavelength
ranges, respectively, and a third channel (Channel-C) taking relative measure-
ments of the Mg ii core/wing ratio between 2750–2850Å. The EUVS–B chan-
nel is comprised of a photodiode array with diode clusters allocated to cover
significant solar emission lines such as C iii (1175Å), H i Lyα (1216Å), C ii
(1335Å), and S iv/O iv (1405Å), each with an approximate width of 6Å. The
final irradiance data from EUVS-B is a summation of the fluxes over the pho-
todiodes for each separate cluster. At the time of writing, these full-disk L2
irradiances from EXIS/EUVS–B are available at 60s cadence, future products
following additional processing are expected to have cadences of 1s. Similar to
red GOES-14/15, GOES-16 operates in a geostationary orbit with an altitude
of approximately 36 000 km (see Eparvier et al. 2009 for a detailed discussion of
EUVS for GOES-16). For this study, Version 1.0.5 of the science-quality solar
line data from GOES-16/EXIS were used; at the time of writing this is the most
up-to-date publicly available version of the GOES-16 data.

Several caveats need to be considered for GOES-16/EXIS-EUVS-B data.
Firstly, the presence of multi-hour post-eclipse thermal dips in the spectral lines
due to incompletely corrected temperature impacts may affect the EUVS obser-
vations, although it is simple to exclude these data as required. The magnitude
of this in the Lyα line is difficult to quantify due to the additional effect of the
geocorona. Furthermore, an annual cycle oscillation artifact with a magnitude
of 1.3% of the measured flux impacts the irradiances of the Lyα channel of
EUVS. It is unclear what impact these may have on the observations presented
in this study.

2.3 PROBA2/LYRA

The Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA; Hochedez et al. 2006, Dominique et al.
2013) onboard PROBA2 is a tri-unit broadband radiometer with four distinct
channels observing in the SXR to mid-ultraviolet regime. The Lyα filters from
Units 1 and 2 (MSM Diamond Detector) and Unit 3 (AXUV Si Detector) of
LYRA cover the 1200–1230Å wavelength range, taking full-disk irradiance mea-
surements at 0.05s cadence. The nominal unit of LYRA has suffered signifi-
cant degradation and no longer observes Lyα emission, due to changes in the
Lyα channel bandpass. The degradation of the LYRA instrument has been
attributed to the deposition of carbon and silicon on the detectors, creating a
contaminant layer that is more opaque to longer wavelengths relative to short

5



resulting in different signal losses depending on wavelength (BenMoussa et al.
2015, Wauters et al. 2022). The data collected during special observing cam-
paigns using the backup unit are still sufficient to observe flare related Lyα
emission (M. Dominique. 2023 - Private Communication). PROBA2 has a
Sun-synchronous orbit at 720 km altitude placing it in Low-Earth Orbit.

2.4 MAVEN/EUVM

The Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor (EUVM) onboard the MAVEN satellite is a
Sun-facing instrument consisting of three channels taking disk-integrated broad-
band irradiances in the SXR and EUV regimes. The Lyα channel (Channel C)
of EUVM covers the 1170–1250Å wavelength range, measuring irradiance at 1s
cadence. Nominal EUVM observations are taken in the operations case with
the Sun within science FOV and aperture mechanism “open”, which produces
valid solar irradiance measurements. MAVEN operates in a highly elliptical
orbit around Mars, with an apoapsis of ∼6000 km and periapsis of ∼150 km.

2.5 SDO/EVE-MEGS-P

SDO/EVE features a set of Multiple EUV Grating Spectrographs (MEGS) com-
prised of three main components. The grazing-incidence spectrograph (MEGS-
A) and normal-incidence spectrograph (MEGS-B) sample the 50-370Å and 350-
1050Å wavelength range at 1Å resolution, respectively2. The broadband photo-
diode (MEGS-P) used with the first grating of MEGS-B is centred on the Lyα
line. SDO operates in a 28◦ inclined geosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 36
000 km. At the time of writing, the degradation of MEGS-B means that MEGS-
P operates on a flare trigger system, with a 60s cadence (previously MEGS-P
has operated with 10s cadence).

2.6 ASO-S/LST-SDI

The ASO-S mission is the first space-based Chinese mission dedicated to solar
observation. The LST is one of the instruments onboard ASO-S. The SDI within
LST images the full solar disk at 1216Å with a spatial resolution of 9.5′′ and
a routine exposure time of 13.5s3. ASO-S operates in a Sun-synchronous orbit
with an altitude of 720 km and an inclination of 98◦ relative to Earth’s equator.
The nominal cadence for routine SDI observations is between 4–40s; SDI images
are also available in 60s intervals due to the “image download interval” set in
response to telemetry limitations.

2Due to an instrumentation failure on 26 May 2014, MEGS-A is no longer operational.
3This has increased to 16.5s due to degradation of the instrument.

3 Spectral Response Functions and Bandpasses

The spectral response of a given instrument quantifies the effectiveness of an
instrument in transforming incident flux into a measurable output for a given
emission spectrum. Figure 1 shows the normalised spectral response for each
broadband instrument described in Section 2. Also presented are the diode re-
sponsivities of GOES-16/EXIS–EUVS–B, where each grey bar denotes a unique
photodiode. Generally, the normalised spectral responses for the broadband Lyα
instruments resemble a Gaussian profile with the central peak residing within
the 1200-1220Å wavelength range. It appears that several of the spectral re-
sponses are centred slightly blueward of the Lyα core at 1216Å (denoted by
the vertical solid black line in Figure 1). The GOES-15/EUVS–E spectral re-
sponse appears to be double peaked, with the larger peak appearing around
1245Å and the average of the two peaks being ∼1227Å. The responsivities for
GOES-16/EXIS–EUVS–B show the distinct clusters centred about their unique
corresponding emission lines, with cluster B positioned about the Lyα core
and the responsivity apparently increasing monotonically with wavelength. It
should be noted that the responses are normalised for comparison and do not
necessarily give an indication of the true instrumental responsivity as they are
dimensionless. The true responsivity may change due to degradation over the
instrument lifetime. The wavelength at the peak of the spectral response for
each instrument is summarised in Table 1.

The FWHM of the spectral response function for each instrument is pre-
sented as a horizontal line in Figure 2. Also included is a model of a daily av-
eraged quiet-Sun (QS) EUV spectrum from the Flare Irradiance Spectral Model

sponds to the Lyα line. The values of the FWHM bandpasses are summarised
in Table 1. From Figure 2, GOES-14/EUVS–E has the broadest bandpass and
MAVEN/EUVM has the narrowest. In terms of FWHM values, the values be-
tween instruments show reasonable similarity. However, the central point of
the bandpass appears to demonstrate a non-negligible difference between each
instrument.

To explore the spectral purity of the observations, the spectral response for
each instrument was convolved with a model QS spectra from FISM2 in the
1080–1420Å wavelength range (Figure 3). From this convolution, it is apparent
that for all the instruments examined the measured irradiance across the full
bandpass is dominated by Lyα. From Figure 3 it is apparent that contributions
to the irradiance from nearby species such as Si iii (1206Å) and O v (1218Å) are
found to be 100–1000× less than that of Lyα, thus suggesting it is reasonable
to assume that the observed irradiance from each instrument is dominated by
Lyα (Woods et al. [2012] state the filter purity of MEGS-P to be 99%).

4 Flare Sample and Analysis

In order to make instrumental comparison between flare observations, three case
studies were conducted each using a unique combination of instruments. The
flare sample used for these studies was selected on the fulfillment of the following
criteria:

• Each flare was M-class or above to facilitate sufficient observable Lyα flux
increases attributed to the flare.

• Each flare was co-observed by the active GOES satellite at the time of the
observation and at least one other instrument from Section 2.

• Each flare occurred on-disk from the respective instrument FOV, reducing
the impact of Centre-to-Limb Variation.

• The full flare period was observed by each instrument examined in that
case study, with a sufficient preflare period to calculate a background flux
value.

• Instruments must be operating in standard observation modes to prevent
additional impact of increased cadences, additional attenuation from fil-
ters, spacecraft maneuvers, and variable pointing (imagers, etc.).

Table 2 presents a summary of three flares that met the above criteria. The
flare timings and classes were taken from the 1–8Å SXR observations from the
XRS instrument on the relevant GOES satellite.

4.1 Standardisation and Calibration

In order to make a reasonable comparison between instruments, Lyα measure-
ments were converted to disk-integrated irradiance at 1AU, in units of Wm−2.

10



The following sections detail the calibration and standardisation procedures
conducted for the relevant instruments.

4.1.1 Scaling Observations to 1AU

As MAVEN is a Mars orbiting mission, a scaling factor is required to convert the
Lyα observations from Mars to Earth distance. This scaling factor is calculated
as (RMS

RES
)2, where RMS and RES are the Mars-Sun and Earth-Sun separation

distances at the time of the flare, respectively. A scaling factor of 2.52 was
found for MAVEN.

Additionally, a light travel-time correction factor was calculated as:

∆t =
RScS −RES

c
seconds (1)

where c is the speed of light in ms−1 and the separation distance is given in
m. This Earth-Mars travel time could then be subtracted from the observation
time to align with observation time taken at 1AU. The calculated value of ∆t
for MAVEN at the time of the flare was found to be 289s. Similar scaling was
performed for Earth-orbiting instruments to ensure all observations were scaled
to 1AU.

4.1.2 Radiometric Calibration of Images

Image data require radiometric calibration in order to covert the pixel data
in DNs−1 to irradiance in Wm−2. For ASO-S/LST-SDI, this calibration was
carried out using the IDL program lst radcalib.pro within the LST anal-
ysis package available from the Science Operation and Data Centre (SODC).
For this calibration, the image data were despiked using “L.A.Cosmic” cos-
mic ray identification algorithm (van Dokkum et al. 2012), incorporated into
the LST software package, and a Radiometric Calibration Factor (RCF) of
1.98×10−8 erg DN−1 cm−2 was applied. The RCF is calculated using the ratio
of EUVS Lyα daily averages from GOES to LST data and is time-dependent
due to degradation of instrument over the mission lifetime. Following this, im-
age data from ASO-S/LST-SDI was converted from spatially-resolved data to
1-dimensional lightcurves via summation of the pixels present in the full-disk
image. It was assumed that the flux within the image exposure time may be
extrapolated across the total imaging cadence. This may have an impact on the
understanding of the temporal behaviour of the flux, although will not impact
the magnitude of Lyα emission.

4.1.3 Centre-to-Limb Variation Correction

Given the position of SOL2016–04–18 on the solar disk, and the differing van-
tage points of GOES-15 and MAVEN, a CLV correction factor was required to
account for the impact of the relative flare position on the observed Lyα emis-
sion. Firstly, a translation of the longitudinal flare position was performed from

the position on-disk as seen from Earth to the approximate position as seen
from Mars. This was carried out under the assumption of an unchanged flare
latitude via the following:

ϕMars = ϕEarth −∆θEarth−Mars (2)

where ϕMars and ϕEarth denote the approximate longitudes as observed from
Mars and Earth, respectively, and ∆θEarth−Mars denotes the angular separation
between Earth and Mars at the time of the flare. The position of Mars relative
to Earth at the time of SOL2016–04–18 is presented in Figure 4. The value
of ∆θEarth−Mars was found to be 15.8◦. From Equation 2, the angle ϕMars

was calculated as ∼44◦, thus giving approximate heliographic coordinates of
SOL2016–04–18 relative to Mars of N11W44.

Following this, a CLV correction factor (C) was calculated for both vantage
points using a cosine-squared method, which is justified by the fall-off of irradi-
ance toward the solar limb as demonstrated by Milligan et al. [2020]. The CLV
correction factor is calculated as:

C = cos2(ω)×
(
1− |ϕ|

360

)
(3)

where ω is the heliographic latitude in degrees and ϕ is the heliographic longitude
in degrees. This yielded CLV correction factors for the MAVEN and GOES-15

12



observations of 0.8030 and 0.8512, respectively. The measured Lyα fluxes from
each instrument were then multiplied by their respective correction factors.

4.1.4 Recalibration of PROBA2/LYRA Data

The PROBA2/LYRA observations for SOL2010–02–08 were studied in detail
by Kretzschmar et al. [2013]. In their study, the authors note that the standard
degradation correction may underestimate the flare irradiance increase. Instead
they opted to manually calibrate the L1 data, correcting for degradation, dark
currents, and spacecraft motion. The Lyα observations from PROBA2/LYRA
were recalibrated using the methods from Kretzschmar et al. [2013] to reproduce
their observations for this study. Dark currents were estimated as a function of
temperature and removed from the irradiance. A multiplicative degradation cor-
rection was applied by dividing the flux by the estimated (approximately linear)
degradation for 08–February–2010. Finally, an orbital correction was applied
by constructing an orbital pattern for 08–February–2010 and dividing the flux
by this. The observations were also degraded to 3s cadence by summation, thus
providing an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

4.2 Flare Analysis

For each flare, the preflare background was taken as the mean flux over a 10
minute period before the XRS start time. The flare contrast was calculated from
the peak flux divided by the background, while the excess flux was taken as the
background subtracted irradiance. The energy radiated in Lyα was found by
converting the background subtracted irradiance from flux measured at Earth
(IEarth) to power radiated at the Sun (PSun) by the following:

PSun = 2πR2 × 107 IEarth erg s−1 (4)

where R is the Sun-Earth distance and all observations were scaled to 1AU. The
value 107 is a conversion factor from J to erg. The total energy for each flare
was then calculated by integrating the power between the GOES X-ray (XRS
1–8Å) start and end times. The uncertainty in the observed fluxes was taken as
the standard deviation of the flux in the preflare background period. Finally,
the time of the measured Lyα peak for each observation relative to the GOES
X-ray peak was calculated as tSXR

Peak − tLyαPeak (∆tPeak) for each instrument. The
uncertainty in peak time was taken as ± cadence

2 .

5.1 SOL2010–02–08

The M2.0 flare that occurred on 08–February–2010 was jointly observed by
GOES-14/EUVS-E and PROBA2/LYRA. An image from the Sun Watcher us-
ing Active Pixel System detector and Image Processing (SWAP; Berghmans
et al. 2006) onboard PROBA2 is presented in Figure 5 and the raw lightcurves
from both instruments are presented in top panel of Figure 6, while the contrasts
and excess fluxes are shown in the bottom panel. From Figure 6 it is apparent
that there is a substantial disagreement between the relative fluxes from GOES-
14/EUVS–E and PROBA2/LYRA, with the flare profile from PROBA2/LYRA
appearing notably lower in comparison to GOES-14/EUVS–E. The peak value
of the relative flux was found to be 7.1 × 10−3 Wm−2 and 6.7 × 10−3Wm−2

for GOES/EUVS–E and PROBA2/LYRA, respectively. The respective peaks
in Lyα from the two instruments appear to show temporal agreement with each
other but not the SXR derivative. Kretzschmar et al. [2013] conducted a de-
tailed analysis of this flare and found similar results in the flux, suggesting this
is due to delayed brightening in the EUV wavelengths as the flare plasma cools
and is therefore coronal in origin.

From the bottom panel of Figure 6, the peak contrasts in Lyα were found to
be approximately 3.5% and 0.7% for GOES-14/EUVS–E and PROBA2/LYRA,
respectively, demonstrating a factor of five difference in their calculated values.

Moreover, the peak value of excess flux was found to vary from 2.4×10−4 Wm−2

and 0.5×10−4 Wm−2 between observations. Converting the excess flux to units
of power and integrating over the full flare period, the total energy radiated in
Lyα as observed by GOES-14/EUVS–E was found to be 1.3 × 1029 erg, three
times larger than that found for PROBA2/LYRA, which was calculated as 0.4×
1029 erg. Such a difference in total energy becomes significant to calculations

of the chromospheric energy budget when compared with HXR spectroscopic
observations.

One explanation for the significant difference in contrast and flare excess
between GOES-14/EUVS-E and PROBA2/LYRA could be contamination of
the LYRA bandpass from continuum emission during QS conditions. Specifically
the response function of unit 2 of PROBA2/LYRA (used for this study) contains
an additional feature at approximately 2000Å, which is beyond the range of
Figure 2. The “out-of-band” continuum emission in this range accounts for
approximately 70% of the observed QS emission in this unit. Despite this, during
flare conditions the enhancements in emission in this spectral range are minimal.
Thus, the relative flare signal measured by PROBA2/LYRA in this case can
be considered to be dominated by Lyα. However, when discussing contrast
and flare excess it is likely that the continuum emission in the preflare signal
may contribute to a large background flux, which in turn leads to a reduced
contrast and flare excess in the overall measurements from PROBA2/LYRA
(M. Dominique. 2024 - Private Communication).

5.2 SOL2016–04–18

The M6.7 flare on 18–April–2016 was co-observed in Lyα from Earth and Mars
by GOES-15/EUVS–E and MAVEN/EUVM, respectively. Imaging for this flare

vations (following the standardisation of the MAVEN/EUVM data and CLV
correction) are presented in the top panel Figure 8. The peak relative flux
was found to be within 4% between GOES-15/EUVS–E and MAVEN/EUVM.
The observations show remarkable temporal agreement. Slight differences in
their temporal behaviour only occur around short bursts, which are captured

17



by MAVEN/EUVM but not GOES-15/EUVS–E due to the factor of 10 differ-
ence in their cadences. The contrasts and excess fluxes calculated from each
observation are presented in the bottom panel of Figure 8. The peak contrasts
for GOES-15/EUVS–E and MAVEN/EUVM were found to be 4.2% and 7.4%,
respectively. The peak values of the excess flux were found to be within a factor
of 1.5, with corresponding total energies of 3.0 × 1029 erg and 5.5 × 1029 erg.
Thus, the energy found using MAVEN/EUVM is almost a factor of two larger
than that of GOES-15/EUVS–E.

5.3 SOL2023–05–09

The M6.5 flare on 09–May–2023 was observed photometrically in Lyα by both
GOES-16/EXIS–EUVS–B and SDO/EVE-MEGS-P, as well as imaged by ASO-
S/LST-SDI. A context image from SDO/AIA (171Å) is presented in Figure 9.
Following the radiometric calibration of the ASO-S/LST-SDI data detailed in
Section 4.1.2, comparison was made with the photometric observations. The top
panel of Figure 10 presents the relative flux from each instrument. It is apparent
that peak relative fluxes for the three observing instruments differ by approx-
imately 6%. The larger flux found SDO/EVE-MEGS-P may be attributed to
broadening of the instrument bandpass over time, which is not necessarily mea-
surable (Woodraska. 2023 - Private Communication).

Figure 10: Flare lightcurves from the analysis of SOL2023–05–09. Top
Panel:Lyα and SXR irradiance lightcurves from GOES-16/EXIS–EUVS–B (blue
dashed), GOES-16/EXIS–XRS (grey solid), ASO-S/LST-SDI (blue dotted), and

and excess flux of Lyα emission for each instrument. The shaded regions denote

Despite the similarity in flare profiles, the contrasts were found to range
from 0.7% to 3.5%. This suggests that despite the similarity in the measured
Lyα peak, the sensitivity to the QS flux levels may drive discrepancies in the
background values with which the contrasts are calculated. Similarly, the peak
excess fluxes differed by up to 2.5×10−4 Wm−2 between all observations, trans-

5.4 Timings

For each flare, the time difference between the GOES SXR peak in the 1–8Å
band and the observed Lyα peak from each instrument was calculated in or-
der to identify any lag or lead times. Figure 11 presents the absolute value
of tSXR

Peak − tLyαPeak (∆tPeak) for each instrument. The uncertainty is taken as
± cadence

2 , given by the horizontal error bars. For SOL2010–02–08 there is a
disparity of 0.6s between the ∆tPeak values calculated for PROBA2/LYRA and
GOES-14/EUVS–E. There is a remarkable agreement between the ∆tPeak val-
ues calculated for GOES-15/EUVS–E and MAVEN/EUVM for SOL2016–04–18
with a discrepancy of 0.3s. For SOL2023–05–09, there is a broad agreement in
∆tPeak between GOES-16/EXIS–EUVS–B and SDO/EVE-MEGS-P, although
the uncertainty of these values is particularly large due to the relatively low (60s)
cadence between measurements. There is a time difference of 16s in ∆tPeak be-
tween these two instruments and ASO-S/LST-SDI. However, the ∆tPeak values
for this flare all lie withing the associated uncertainties of one another. Gener-
ally, the peak times between instruments are in relatively good agreement with
each other given the associated uncertainties in the recorded times.

6 Discussion and Future Missions

In this work, we present an inter-instrument comparison of flare-related Lyα
observations for three M-class flares, focussing on the relative and excess flux,

20



the calculated flare contrast, and the total radiated energy. From this we find
measurement inconsistencies to exist to a varying degree across seven different
Lyα instruments. The key findings are as follows:

• Relative fluxes between instruments for all three flares examined here are
in sufficient agreement, such that the conclusions drawn from their analysis
will be negligibly impacted by the choice of instrument.

• Discrepancies in the contrasts and excess fluxes are of sufficient degree to
have a substantial effect on the conclusions drawn from multi-instrument
Lyα studies.

• The calculated energies between instruments are sufficiently different to
potentially have a significant impact on constraining the contribution of
Lyα to the radiated energy budget of solar flares.

• The flare timings between instruments are in relatively good agreement
considering the uncertainties and therefore are minimally impacted by the
choice of observing instrument.

Milligan et al. [2020] demonstrated that 95 % of M- and X-class flares ob-
served by GOES-15/EUVS–E have an associated Lyα contrast of ≤10%, with
an upper limit to the contrast of ∼30 %, while Raulin et al. [2013] found Lyα
contrasts measured by PROBA2/LYRA to be consistently <1%. The flares ex-
amined here were found to have contrasts ranging from 0.3% up to 7.4%, but
importantly it has been demonstrated here that these ranges may be influenced
by the observing instrument. The findings presented here show that the contrast
range may vary by up to ∼3.5% depending on the observing instrument. This
discrepancy is over half of the range of contrast variability found in Greatorex
et al. [2023]. Moreover, it has been shown that the calculated values of excess
flux can vary by up to a factor of five between instruments. This implies that
analyses of solar flare excess in Lyα may be significantly impacted by the choice
of observing instrument, thus influencing the conclusions drawn from flare ob-
servations and further calculations of the flare energy carried out using these
fluxes. On the contrary, the values of relative flux were found to be in sufficient
agreement such that any analysis done with these fluxes would be minimally
impacted by the discrepancies between observations from different instruments.

Calculations of the radiated energy in Lyα are also vital for estimating the
contribution of this wavelength (and therefore others) to the radiated energy
budget of the chromosphere. Relatively few studies have compared the radiated
energy in Lyα to the incident nonthermal electron energy deposited into the
chromosphere during flares. From those studies, Lyα has been found to radi-
ate up to ∼8% of the chromospheric energy (Milligan et al. 2014). Here it has
been demonstrated that calculations of the radiated energy in Lyα may vary by
up to an order of magnitude between observations from different instruments.
This has significant implication for statistical studies attempting to quantify
the radiated energy in Lyα over a large flare sample, particularly when using

21



multiple instruments as part of those observations. In this work, it has not been
possible to compute the nonthermal electron energies for each flare due to a lack
of uniform HXR observations from a single observing instrument. Introducing
variation in HXR observations will add unnecessary excess uncertainty in calcu-
lated energies that may distract from the discrepancies in the Lyα observations.
Under the assumption of a single nonthermal energy for each flare, the discrep-
ancies in the calculated Lyα energy could substantially alter estimates of the
percentage contribution of Lyα emission to the radiated energy budget of the
chromosphere.

Data driven models such as FISM2 depend on observations to form statis-
tics, from which approximations can be made for emission spectra from solar
flares. These models have application in the study of atmospheric responses to
solar flares (Qian et al. 2010, 2011, 2012, Lollo et al. 2012), as well as in the
development of models designed to aid in the analysis of observations from mis-
sions such as MAVEN (Thiemann et al. 2017, Chaffin et al. 2015, Chaufray et al.
2015, Jain et al. 2015, Sakai et al. 2016). The interpretation of the results from
studies employing these models is thus reliant on the precision and credibility
of the underlying observations.

Significant disagreement in the observed Lyα peak times between GOES/EUVS–
E and SDO/EVE-MEGS-P were presented by Milligan and Chamberlin [2016].
They found a delay in peak times between instruments of 5–10 minutes, which
was eventually attributed to the Kalman filter used to smooth data in SDO/EVE
processing; this filter was subsequently replaced with a Fourier transform filter,
which ultimately prevented the recurrence of this issue. The time discrepancies
presented in this work are not as substantial as those presented in Milligan and
Chamberlin [2016]; the differences in peak times between instruments could be
attributed to the variability in cadences, or in the case of imagers, the assump-
tions of constant flux between exposure, which may be an oversimplification
of the true behaviour of the Lyα flux. While temporal discrepancies between
observations may not have a substantial impact on calculations flare energetics,
they may affect the understanding of energy transport processes in flares as well
as the derived relationships between solar flares and associated atmospheric re-
sponses in the unique sub-regions of the ionosphere (Berdermann et al. 2018,
Raulin et al. 2013, Hayes et al. 2021, Milligan et al. 2020, Chakraborty et al.
2021, Barta et al. 2022).

The convolution of the FISM2 spectra in Section 3 demonstrates that there
is minimal contribution to the total measured Lyα irradiance from additional
species in the bandpass of each instrument. Minor variations between instru-
ments are present in the wings of the Lyα profile as well as in the blueward
and redward wavelengths surrounding the Lyα line. However, the core emission
significantly dominates the measured flux in all cases by at least two orders of
magnitude, therefore the total measured irradiance may be considered to be
predominantly from the Lyα line.

Given the standardisation of the observations carried out in this work, it is
implicit that the observed discrepancies found between instruments are unlikely
to be attributable to the observation field of view or observing techniques of

22



the instruments. Instead, the discrepancies in the measured flux between in-
struments may be driven by inherent properties of the instrument itself or the
calibration process carried out on the raw data. Absorption from the goecorona
may be able to account for differences in observed flux between instruments at
different orbital heights. Specifically, satellites in Low-Earth Orbit may mea-
sure lower levels of Lyα irradiance compared to those with more extended orbits
due to the absorption of Lyα photons by Hydrogen in the Earth’s geocorona.
Wauters et al. [2022] suggested that geocornal absorption may be a poten-
tial explanation for a factor of 20 difference between GOES-15/EUVS-E and
PROBA2/LYRA observations of a solar flare in Lyα. Additionally, the spectral
assumptions used to scale observations for each instrument may influence the
returned flare profiles. For example, GOES-15/EUVS-E data are scaled to the
Whole Heliosphere Interval QS reference spectrum and thus systematic uncer-
tainties may be present in the observed flare data (Woods et al. 2009, Milligan
2021).

Ultimately, it is important to acknowledge any discrepancy in observations
between instruments, particularly when conducting multi-instrument studies,
which are becoming evermore possible with the expanding availability of flare-
related Lyα observations. Previously, GOES observations in the SXRs have
been considered the “industry standard” for flare classifications and timings. It
may be of value to establish some form of agreeable standard of observation to
scale measurements from dedicated Lyα missions to. Analysis of results from
upcoming missions with Lyα observing capabilities such as Solar-C featuring
the Solar Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SoSpIM; Harra et al. 2022), and the The
Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS; Chamberlin et al. 2020)
sounding rocket will benefit from recognition of the diversity of conclusions that
may be drawn from Lyα observations depending on the observing instrument.
The findings presented here may guide interpretation of the observations taken
by the current and new generation of Lyα instruments as part of future studies.
