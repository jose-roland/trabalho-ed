Abstract

Distribution of entanglement is an essential task in quantum information processing and the realization of
quantum networks. In our work, we theoretically investigate the scenario where a central source prepares
an N -partite entangled state and transmits each entangled subsystem to one of N receivers through noisy
quantum channels. The receivers are then able to perform local operations assisted by unlimited classical
communication to distill target entangled states from the noisy channel output. In this operational context,
we define the EPR distribution capacity and the GHZ distribution capacity of a quantum channel as the largest
rates at which Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states can be
faithfully distributed through the channel, respectively. We establish lower and upper bounds on the EPR
distribution capacity by connecting it with the task of assisted entanglement distillation. We also construct
an explicit protocol consisting of a combination of a quantum communication code and a classical-post-
processing-assisted entanglement generation code, which yields a simple achievable lower bound for generic
channels. As applications of these results, we give an exact expression for the EPR distribution capacity over
two erasure channels and bounds on the EPR distribution capacity over two generalized amplitude damping
channels. We also bound the GHZ distribution capacity, which results in an exact characterization of the GHZ
distribution capacity when the most noisy channel is a dephasing channel.

1 Introduction

Entanglement distribution is an essential ingredient in realizing the quantum internet [1, 2], which has the
potential of accomplishing tasks such as quantum key distribution [3, 4], distributed quantum computing [5],
and distributed quantum sensing [6]. To successfully implement these protocols, the participating parties,
which may be separated by significant spatial distance, need to share high-fidelity entangled states. Typically,
the distribution of entanglement to distant parties suffers from noise, deteriorating the quality of entanglement.
Therefore, a key research thrust in quantum information science is to study protocols that allow us to distribute
high-fidelity entangled states to distant parties.

In previous works on entanglement distribution, it is frequently assumed that one party prepares an
N -partite entangled state, holds on to one subsystem which remains intact in a local quantum memory, and
sends the other N − 1 subsystems to the remaining N − 1 parties through quantum channels. The parties
may also use unlimited local operation and classical communication (LOCC) post-processing to enhance the
distribution of entanglement. This is illustrated in Fig. 1a. For instance, in Refs. [7, 8], the distribution of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states is accomplished by locally generating n copies of EPR states ϕA1S2 at A1,
who sends the Sn2 systems through n uses of a quantum channel N S2→A2 to another party A2. Subsequently,
A1 and A2 employ either the hashing protocol or the convolutional protocol to distill high-fidelity EPR
pairs between them. The convolutional method has further been extended to the distribution of tripartite
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states |GHZ3⟩ = 1/

√
2(|000⟩+ |111⟩)[9]. Similarly, this process involves

locally generating n copies of |GHZ3⟩⟨GHZ3|A1S2S3 , sending Sn2 and Sn3 to A2 and A3 respectively, and
performing a distillation protocol inspired by quantum error correction. Building on this work, Ref. [10]
adopted quantum low-density parity-check codes [11, 12] to construct a high-rate tripartite GHZ distribution
protocol with efficient post-processing. Conversely, if we can prepare arbitrary bipartite entangled states and
implement arbitrary LOCC post-processing, Tomamichel et al. provide a fundamental upper bound on the
asymptotically achievable rates for distributing EPR states [13].

However, we argue that this previously adopted model is inadequate for the following two reasons. First,
the assumption that the local quantum memory is noiseless is hardly justified in practice. Secondly, we envision
that, in the near-term, the ability to generate and distribute quantum entanglement may be localized to a few
central stations, which send the entangled states to users through quantum channels whenever they request
them. Therefore, in our work, we instead consider a more practical scenario where a source prepares an
N -partite entangled state ρS1···SN

init and sends subsystem Si to receivers Ai through quantum channels N Si→Ai
i .

After receiving the noisy output state, the receivers perform LOCC amongst themselves to distill the desired
target state τ from the noisy output state (Fig 1b).

The focus of the present paper is to investigate the ultimate entanglement distribution rate in this setting,
characterized by the best asymptotic rate achievable when the source is able to use each channel an unbounded
number of times. In this work, we choose τ to be the N -partite GHZ state |GHZN ⟩ = 1/

√
2(|0⟩⊗N + |1⟩⊗N ).

While there is no “maximally entangled” state in the multipartite setting [14, 15], GHZ states are still an
important class of states to consider because of their nonlocality properties [16, 17] and their applications in
quantum information tasks such as quantum secret sharing [18], quantum conference key agreement [19],
and quantum sensing [20]. For these reasons, the distillation of GHZ states is an important question that is
under active research [9, 10, 21–25]. For example, Salek and Winter recently proposed a GHZ distillation
protocol by “making coherent” the classical common randomness distillation protocol. Moreover, when N = 2,
the task reduces to distributing EPR pairs across two receivers, which is an interesting scenario in its own right.
We will call the largest rate at which bipartite maximally entangled states can be distributed through channels
N1 and N2 the EPR distribution capacity of N1 and N2 and denote it by E(N1,N2). Similarly, the largest rate
at which GHZ states can be distributed through N1, · · · ,NN will be called the GHZ distribution capacity of
these channels, denoted by E(N1, · · · ,NN ).

The main goal of this paper is to characterize the optimal N -party GHZ distribution rates over noisy
channels, especially for the case of N = 2. In Section 2, we provide preliminary information on quantum
capacities, entanglement distillation, and simulation of a quantum channel by its Choi states, all of which
are useful for the exposition of our results in later sections. We also provide a detailed definition of the
entanglement distribution capacity in Section 2.5. Our first contribution is the connection between the task of
distributing EPR states to N = 2 parties with the task of assisted entanglement distillation [26–30] (Section 3).
Specifically, we show that for general channels N1 and N2, the regularized entanglement of assistance of the
Choi states offers a lower bound for E(N1,N2). For teleportation-covariant channels, this lower bound is tight
and exactly equals the entanglement distribution rate. As an application of this result, we exactly characterize
the entanglement distribution capacity when the two channels are both erasure channels in Section 3.1. In
Section 4, we provide another lower bound for E(N1,N2) by combining quantum communication codes
with entanglement generation codes assisted by classical-post-processing (CPP). This bound is tight when
the quantum capacity of one channel is greater than the CPP-assisted entanglement generation capacity of
the other channel and not tight in general. In particular, for the case of EPR distribution over generalized
amplitude damping channels (GADCs), we can enhance the achievable rates in the high-noise regime by using
multi-rail encoding (Section 4.1). In Section 5, we derive general bounds for GHZ distribution, which yields
an exact expression of GHZ distribution capacity when the most noisy channel is a dephasing channel. Finally,
Section 6 discusses the implications of our results and concludes the paper.

2 Preliminaries

In this section, we review basic concepts of quantum communication, entanglement generation with classical
post-processing, assisted entanglement distillation, and simulation of teleportation covariant channels. Then
we proceed to precisely define the primary focus of our paper: entanglement distribution through quantum
channels N1,N2, · · · ,NN .

2.1 Quantum Communication and Quantum Capacity

Given a quantum channel NA→B , an (n,Qn, ϵn) quantum communication code consists of an encoder ES→An

where 1
n log dimS = Qn and a decoder DBn→S such that∥∥∥ψRS − idR ⊗

(
DBn→S ◦ N⊗n ◦ ES→An (

ψRS
))∥∥∥

1
≤ ϵn (1)

for all pure states ψRS . A rate Q is achievable if there exists a sequence of (n,Qn, ϵn) quantum communication
codes such that limn→∞Qn = Q and limn→∞ ϵn = 0. The quantum capacity of the channel N , denoted by
Q(N ), is the supremum of all achievable rates. It has been established that the quantum capacity of a quantum
channel is characterized by its coherent information. The coherent information of a bipartite state ρAB is given
by [31]

Ic(A⟩B)ρ = S(B)− S(AB) (2)

where S(AB) and S(B) are the von Neumann entropies of the state ρAB and the reduced state ρB respectively.
The coherent information of a quantum channel NA′→B is given by maximizing (2) over all states of the form
ρAB = idA ⊗NA′→B(ψAA

′
) with pure input ψAA

′
:

Ic(N ) = max
ψAA′

Ic(A⟩B)ρ (3)

Then, the quantum capacity of a quantum channel N is given by [32–34]:

Q(N ) = lim
n→∞

1

n
Ic(N⊗n) ≥ Ic(N ). (4)

2.2 Entanglement Generation Assisted by Classical Post-Processing (CPP)

Given a quantum channel NA→B , an (n,Qn, ϵn) entanglement generation code assisted by CPP consists of an
encoding operation EA0→ÃAn

where A0
∼= C is trivial and an LOCC post-processing LÃBn→ÂB̂ such that∥∥∥ϕÂB̂ − LÃB

n→ÂB̂ ◦ N⊗n ◦ EA0→ÃAn
∥∥∥
1
≤ ϵn (5)

where ϕ is the maximally entangled state with Schimdt rank 2nQn . A rate Q is achievable assisted by CPP if
there exists a sequence of (n,Qn, ϵn) CPP-assisted entanglement generation codes such that limn→∞Qn = Q
and limn→∞ ϵn = 0. The CPP assisted entanglement generation capacity of the channel N , denoted by
Ecpp(N ), is the supremum of all achievable entanglement generation rates assisted by CPP. A lower bound of
Ecpp(N ) is the reverse coherent information [35], which is defined by

IR(N ) = max
ψAA′

Ic(B⟩A)ρ (6)

where again ρAB = idA ⊗NA′→B(ψAA
′
). Conversely, an upper bound is given by the Rains information of the

channel. The Rains relative entropy of a bipartite state ρAB is given by [36]

R(A;B)ρ = inf
σ∈PPT′

D(ρ∥σ) (7)

where D(ρ∥σ) = Trρ(log ρ − log σ) is the quantum relative entropy and PPT′ = {σAB : σ ≥ 0, ∥σTB∥1 ≤ 1}
with TB denoting the partial transpose on system B. We can similarly define the Rains information of a
quantum channel by optimizing (7) over states of the form ρAB = idA ⊗NA′→B(ψAA

′
) with ψAA

′
pure [13]:

R(N ) = max
ψAA′

R(A;B)ρ. (8)

2.3 Assisted Entanglement Distillation

Suppose n copies of a tripartite mixed state ρABC are shared between A, B, and a helper C, and the goal is to
distill bipartite entanglement between A and B with the help of C, who assists by performing a measurement
on his system and broadcasting the result to A and B (Fig. 2b). More precisely, a (n,Qn, ϵn)-assisted
entanglement distillation protocol with C being the helper consists of a POVM {MCn

i }i and the corresponding
LOCC operations LAnBn→ÂB̂

where ϕ is the maximally entangled state with Schimdt rank 2nQn . A rate Qn is achievable if there ex-
ists a sequence of (n,Qn, ϵn)-assisted entanglement distillation protocols such that limn→∞Qn = Q and
limn→∞ ϵn = 0. Dutil and Hayden showed that the supremum of all achievable rates is given by [28]

where the supremum is taken over all POVMs {Mi}i on C. We will call DA(ρ) the entanglement of assistance

2.4 Simulating Teleportation-Covariant Channels

Consider a qudit quantum teleportation protocol [37]. A d-dimensional maximally entangled state ϕABd is
shared between two parties A and B. In addition, A possesses an arbitrary quantum state ρA

′
. Suppose

A performs a measurement on AA′ in the basis

a,b

. Here Xd is the shift unitary

defined by Xd|k⟩ = |k ⊕ 1⟩ where ⊕ denotes addition modulo d, and the clock unitary Zd is defined by
Zd|k⟩ = ei2πk/d|k⟩. The set of unitaries of the form Uab = Xa

dZ
b
d are called generalized Pauli unitaries. After

the measurement, the state on B becomes Xa

†, depending on the measurement result a, b. Once
B learns the measurement result from A, the state can be corrected back to ρ by performing the appropriate
unitary.

A qudit quantum channel NA→B is called teleportation-covariant if for any generalized Pauli unitary UA

and for any input state ρA, we have

NA→B(UAρAU†A) = V BNA→B(ρA)V †B (12)

for some unitary V B. Teleportation-covariant channels can be simulated by their Choi state JABN = idA ⊗
NA′→B(ϕAA

′

d ) and one-way LOCC [38]. To see this, note that if we replace ϕd with JN in the teleportation
protocol, the state on B after measurement on AA′ becomes N (UabρU

†
ab). By teleportation covariance this

is equivalent to VabN (ρ)V †
ab for some unitary Vab depending on the measurement result. Once B learns the

measurement result, one can apply an appropriate unitary to correct the state back to N (ρ).

2.5 Entanglement Distribution from a Central Source

In this section, we rigorously define EPR and GHZ distribution capacities, which are the focal points in our
work. Given N quantum channels {NSi→Ai

operation ES0→Sn

where Qn = k/n. A pictorial description can be found in Fig. 1b. We will focus on the case where
τ = |GHZN ⟩⟨GHZN |. A rate Q is achievable if there exists an (n,Qn, ϵn)-GHZ distribution code such that
limn→∞Qn = Q and limn→∞ ϵn = 0. The GHZ distribution capacity E(N1, · · · ,NN ) is the supremum of all
achievable rates. When N = 2, this similarly defines the EPR distribution capacity E(N1,N2).

3 Connection between Entanglement Distribution and Assisted Entan-
glement Distillation

We begin with the simplest case where N = 2. Our first result is a connection between EPR distribution
capacity E(N1,N2) and the assisted entanglement distillation rate on the Choi states D∞

where S acts as the assistant party.

(15)

where dSi

means that performing a POVM {Mi} on J⊗n

followed by the corresponding LOCC post-processing
Li is equivalent to probabilistically sending states MT

i /TrMT
i through N⊗n

1 ⊗ N⊗n
2 followed by the same

post-processing Li. The latter is clearly less desirable than deterministically performing the optimal EPR
distribution protocol.

For the second part of the theorem, recall that if a channel is teleportation-covariant, its action can be
simulated by a teleportation protocol with its Choi state as the resource state. Therefore, an EPR distribution
protocol with input state ρS

1 S

n
2 and LOCC post-processing is equivalent to the scheme illustrated in Fig. 3.

Since any state that is local to S cannot help distill bipartite entanglement between A1 and A2, this is
further equivalent to assisted entanglement distillation on (JN1

)⊗n. It then follows that E(N1,N2) ≤

.

In general, the asymptotic entanglement of assistance D∞
A (ρ) is very hard to mathematically character-

ize. To simplify its characterization, we introduce the Rains relative entropy of assistance RA(ρ) and its
regularization, namely the asymptotic Rains relative entropy of assistance R∞

A (ρ):

where R(A;B)ρ is the Rains relative entropy introduced in Section 2. By definition RA(ρ) ≥ DA(ρ) and
R∞
A (ρ) ≥ D∞

A (ρ). Desirably, the Rains relative entropy of assistance RA(ρ) is convex, and we will later apply
this property to characterize the EPR distribution capacity of two erasure channels.

Proposition 2. The Rains information of assistance is convex.

Proof. Consider an arbitrary decomposition ρABC =

where the inequality follows from the convexity of Rains information. Optimizing over all POVMs on both
sides of the inequality we obtain

RA(ρ

which concludes the proof.

3.1 Application to Erasure channels

Consider qudit erasure channels of the form Ep(ρ) = (1 − p)ρ + p|e⟩⟨e|, where |e⟩ is a flag state orthogonal
to the input space, signaling the erasure of the input. As an application of the previous results, we exactly
characterize the EPR distribution capacity of two qudit erasure channels.

Theorem 3. E(Ep1 , Ep2) = (1− p1)(1− p2) log d.

Proof. Clearly, (1 − p1)(1 − p2) log d is achievable by sending ϕd through the channels. With probability
(1− p1)(1− p2) no erasure occurs, whereas with probability 1− (1− p1)(1− p2) an erasure error occurs on at
least one of A1 and A2. They can locally detect erasure errors and classically communicate if an erasure error
occurred and discard any such states. This results in a rate of (1− p1)(1− p2) log d. Conversely, since erasure

channels are teleportation-covariant, E(Ep1 , Ep2) = D∞

4 An Explicit Protocol Construction for EPR Distribution

While we have established a connection between E(N1,N2) and D∞
A (JN1 ⊗ JN2) and used the connection to

give an exact expression of the EPR distribution capacity of two erasure channels, it is in general difficult to
mathematically characterize the asymptotic entanglement of assistance D∞

A . In this section, we introduce a
simple lower bound of the EPR distribution capacity based on a direct construction.

Theorem 4. E(N1,N2) ≥ max{min{Q(N1), Ecpp(N2)},min{Q(N2), Ecpp(N1)}}.

Proof. Let Q := min{Q(N1), Ecpp(N2)}. By the definitions of unassisted quantum capacity and CPP assisted
entanglement generation capacity, for any ϵ1, ϵ2 ∈ (0, 1) and δ > 0, there exists an (n,Q − δ, ϵ1) quantum
communication code (E1,D1) for N1 and an (n,Q− δ, ϵ2) CPP assisted entanglement generation code (E2,L2)
for N2, as long as n is sufficiently large. Our GHZ distribution protocol then consists of an encoding operation

E := ES→Sn

where the first inequality follows from the triangle inequality, the second inequality follows from the fact
that (E2,L2) is a CPP assisted entanglement generation code and the data processing inequality, and the
final inequality follows from the fact that (E1,D1) is a quantum communication code over N1. Therefore, we
conclude that for any ϵ1, ϵ2 ∈ (0, 1) and δ > 0, there exists a (n,Q− δ, ϵ1 + ϵ2) EPR distribution protocol for
sufficiently large n. This means that Q is an achievable EPR distribution rate. Interchanging N1 and N2 proves
we can achieve min{Q(N2), Ecpp(N1)} as well, which establishes the theorem.

7



Remark. Since Ecpp(N ) ≥ Q(N ) for an arbitrary channel N , we deduce E(N1,N2) ≥ min{Q(N1), Q(N2)}.

Remark. Evidently, E(N1,N2) ≤ E(N1, id) ≤ Ecpp(N1). By the same argument E(N1,N2) ≤ Ecpp(N2) as
well. Thus, E(N1,N2) ≤ min{Ecpp(N1), Ecpp(N2)} ≤ min{R(N1), R(N2)}. A consequence of this observation
is that the lower bound in Thm. 4 is tight when the quantum capacity of a channel is greater than the
entanglement generation capacity of the other channel. To see this, suppose without loss of generality
that Q(N1) ≥ Ecpp(N2), then Ecpp(N1) ≥ Q(N1) ≥ Ecpp(N2) ≥ Q(N2). The lower bound thus implies
E(N1,N2) ≥ max{Ecpp(N2), Q(N2)} = Ecpp(N2).

4.1 Generalized Amplitude Damping Channels

Generalized amplitude damping channels Aγ,T model the T1 relaxation process due to the coupling of a
spin-1/2 system to a thermal reservoir at a higher temperature than that of the spin system [39, p. 382]. The
Kraus operators

K1 =
√
1− T

(
|0⟩⟨0|+

√
1− γ|1⟩⟨1|

)
, (35)

K2 =
√
γ(1− T )|0⟩⟨1|, (36)

K3 =
√
T
(√

1− γ|0⟩⟨0|+ |1⟩⟨1|
)
, (37)

K4 =
√
γT |1⟩⟨0|. (38)

If the thermal parameter T = 0, then K3 and K4 vanish, and the channel reduces to the ordinary amplitude
damping channel Aγ := Aγ,0, which models the case where the thermal reservoir is at zero temperature. While
there are no exact expressions for the quantum capacity or the CPP-assisted entanglement generation capacity
for GADCs presently, the coherent information and the Rains information of GADCs have been computed in
Refs. [35] and Ref. [40] respectively. Note that a GADC Aγ,T is anti-degradable when γ ≥ 1/2 and thus its
quantum capacity necessarily vanishes, while the Rains information does not necessarily vanish. This means
there is potentially a large gap between the lower bound given above and the upper bound. This motivates us
to find better lower bounds.

In the following, we detail an improved protocol based on multi-rail encoding [41–43]. Let us illustrate
the idea with amplitude damping channels and dual-rail encoding. Using dual-rail encoding, the receivers
are able to detect damping errors. More precisely, we send the state |ψ2⟩ = 1√

2
(|01⟩|01⟩+ |10⟩|10⟩) through

A⊗2
γ1 ⊗A⊗2

γ2 :

ρ = A⊗2
γ1 ⊗A⊗2

γ2 (ψ2) = (1− γ1)(1− γ2)ψ2 +
γ1(1− γ2)

2

+
(1− γ1)γ2

2
(|0100⟩⟨0100|+ |1000⟩⟨1000|) + γ1γ2|0000⟩⟨0000| (40)

A1 and A2 then both post-select on the one-particle sector, i.e., they both perform the projection P =
|01⟩⟨01|+ |10⟩⟨10|, and the post-selected state is ρ′ = (P ⊗ P )ρ(P ⊗ P )/Tr(P ⊗ P )ρ(P ⊗ P ). This procedure
produces a rank-2 maximally entangled state with probability (1− γ1)(1− γ2), meaning we can achieve the
rate of (1− γ1)(1− γ2)/2 per channel use. More generally, we can use multi-rail encoding:

|ψk⟩ =
1√
k
(|00 · · · 01⟩|00 · · · 01⟩+ |00 · · · 10⟩|00 · · · 10⟩+ · · ·+ |10 · · · 00⟩|10 · · · 00⟩). (41)

The receivers again post-select on the one-particle sector, producing a rank-k maximally entangled state
with probability (1− γ1)(1− γ2), thus achieving the rate of (1− γ1)(1− γ2) log k/k. It is easy to check that
supk∈Z+

log k/k is achieved when k = 3. Therefore, the largest rate that we can achieve with multi-rail
encoding is (1− γ1)(1− γ2) log 3/3.

This strategy can be adapted to generalized amplitude damping channels. We again use multi-rail encoding
and post-select on the one-particle subspace. After post-selection, the two receivers perform the hashing
protocol [44]. The rates achievable with dual-rail encoding are plotted in Fig. 4.

5 GHZ distribution

In this section, we establish bounds for the GHZ distribution capacity E(N1, · · · ,NN ) with N > 2.

Theorem 5. E(N1, · · · ,NN ) ≥ miniQ(Ni).

Figure 4: Lower and upper bounds of the bipartite entanglement distribution capacity, assuming the two
channels are generalized amplitude damping channels with the same parameters.

Proof. Let Q := miniQ(Ni). By definition of unassisted quantum capacity, for each channel Ni and for all
ϵi ∈ (0, 1), δ > 0, there exists an (n,Q− δ, ϵi) quantum communication code (Ei,Di) for sufficiently large n.

Our GHZ distribution protocol then consists of an encoding operation E :=

where in the first inequality follows from the triangle inequality, and the second inequality follows from the fact
that (E1,D1) is a quantum communication code for N1 and the data processing inequality for trace distance.
Following this procedure iteratively, we find that∥∥∥|GHZ⟩⟨GHZ| −

Therefore, we conclude that for any ϵi ∈ (0, 1) and δ > 0, there exists a (n,Q− δ,

protocol for sufficiently large n. In other words, Q is an achievable rate.

Conversely, we establish an upper bound in terms of CPP-assisted entanglement generation capacity.

Theorem 6. E(N1, · · · ,NN ) ≤ miniEcpp(Ni).

Proof. For an arbitrary receiver Ai, we ignore the locality constraint on the other receivers {Aj : j ̸= i} and
regard them as a single receiver Aic that receives channel output from all of {Nj : j ̸= i}. Clearly, the GHZ
distribution capacity between A1, · · · , AN cannot be higher than the EPR distribution capacity between Ai
and Aic . This implies the following chain of inequalities:

E(N1, · · · ,NN ) ≤ E
(
Ni,

⊗
j ̸=i

Nj

)
≤ E(Ni, id) ≤ Ecpp(Ni). (47)

Since this argument works for arbitrary i, the stated theorem holds.

A few remarks are in order here. First, perhaps surprisingly, the achievable rate we derived in Theorem 5
effectively neglects the less noisy channels, treating them as if they were noiseless. Second, this rate can be
achieved without the assistance of classical communication. In fact, without classical communication, this
is precisely the largest rate that is achievable. Finally, the upper bound is also tight when LOCC operations

9



between the receivers and the central node are allowed. To see this, the source node can establish Ecpp(Ni)
EPR pairs between S and Ai per use of each Ni. Then the source node prepares an N -partite GHZ state
and teleports each subsystem to Ai by using the established EPR pairs. This establishes GHZ states among
Ai at a rate of miniEcpp(Ni). Therefore, one can view the quantitative difference between the minimum
quantum capacity miniQ(Ni), the GHZ distribution capacity E(N1, · · · ,NN ), and the minimum CPP-assisted
entanglement generation capacity miniEcpp(Ni) as a result of different levels of classical communication
between parties in a quantum network.

A corollary of the previous theorem is an exact expression of the GHZ distribution capacity for when the
“worst” channel is a dephasing channel.

Proposition 7. Consider N channels Zp,N2, · · · ,NN where the Ni are channels satisfying Q(Ni) ≥ Q(Zp) =
1− h2(p) for all i > 1. Then E(Zp,N2, · · · ,NN ) = 1− h2(p).

Proof. The statement follows directly from the fact that Q(Zp) = Ecpp(Zp) = 1− h2(p) [13].

There is an alternative strategy to distribute GHZ states to N parties that contrasts with Thm. 5. The
central node can distribute bipartite EPR pairs to every pair of receivers. The receivers then use these EPR
pairs to build GHZ states. This is detailed in the following theorem.

Theorem 8. E(N1, · · · ,NN ) ≥ N

2(N − 1)
min
i̸=j

E(Ni,Nj).

Proof. For sufficiently large n, the central node can distribute nE(NA,NB) EPR pairs to two receivers A and B
by n uses of NA and n uses of NB . By using n(N−1) times each Ni, each pair of receivers Ai and Aj will share
nE(Ni,Nj) EPR pairs. Let |ΦN ⟩A1···AN :=

⊗
i̸=j |ϕ+⟩AiAj , then the receivers share at least mini,j nE(Ni,Nj)

copies of |ΦN ⟩. Now, |ΦN ⟩⊗2 can be converted to |GHZN ⟩⊗N via LOCC. This is because each Ai can locally
prepare an N -partite GHZ state and use the EPR pairs between Ai and the other parties to create |GHZN ⟩.
Two EPR pairs between each Ai and Aj will be used (once when Ai prepares the GHZ state and once when Aj
prepares the GHZ state). Therefore, a rate of N

2(N−1) mini ̸=j E(Ni,Nj) is achievable.

6 Conclusion and Discussion

In conclusion, we study the entanglement distribution scheme where a single central source aims to establish
entanglement among N receivers through quantum channels N1, · · · ,NN . We define the EPR distribution
capacity E(N1,N2) and the GHZ distribution capacity E(N1, · · · ,NN ) as the largest asymptotic rate of
establishing EPR states among two receivers and N -partite GHZ states among the N receivers, respectively. We
show that EPR distribution is tightly related to the problem of assisted entanglement distillation. Specifically,
we prove a lower bound in terms of the asymptotic entanglement of assistance and show that this bound is tight
for teleportation-covariant channels. This result allows us to exactly characterize the EPR distribution capacity
of two erasure channels. Then, we give alternative simple lower bounds for the EPR distribution capacity over
generic channels as well as the EPR distribution capacity over two generalized amplitude damping channels.
Finally, we bound the GHZ-distribution capacity in terms of the minimum quantum capacity and minimum
CPP-assisted entanglement generation capacities of the channels. Applying these bounds, we exactly determine
the GHZ distribution capacity when the most noisy channel is a dephasing channel.

Our work sheds light on the novel connection between two distinct information theoretic tasks and
motivates a deeper understanding of assisted entanglement distillation. Moreover, our work also hints at a
better scheme of distributing entanglement. Suppose two parties A and B are connected by an optical fiber,
and we assume that the polarization dispersion in the optical fiber are characterized by dephasing channels
[45]. If they wish to share an entangled pair, instead of generating entanglement at one of the parties, say A,
who sends half of the entangled state through the entire length of the fiber, a better strategy is to generate
entanglement from a source S that is located centrally between A and B. By virtue of Proposition 7, in this
alternative strategy, the rate of entanglement distribution depends only on the more noisy link between the
source and the receivers, treating the other link as noiseless. The analysis of our entanglement distribution
scheme shows how it is possible to quantify its performance in terms of information rates. Its operational
relevance and the existence of alternative schemes for different scenarios, therefore, make this area of research
rich of insights and practical applications which are worth further exploring.
