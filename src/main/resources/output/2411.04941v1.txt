Abstract

This paper evaluates the experimental generation of internal solitary waves
(ISWs) in a miscible two-layer system with a free surface using a jet-array
wavemaker (JAW). Unlike traditional gate-release experiments, the JAW system
generates ISWs by forcing a prescribed vertical distribution of mass flux. Experi-
ments examine three different layer-depth ratios, with ISW amplitudes up to the
maximum allowed by the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) solution.
Phase speeds and wave profiles are captured via planar laser-induced fluorescence
and the velocity field is measured synchronously using particle imaging velocime-
try. Measured properties are directly compared with the eKdV predictions. As
expected, small- and intermediate-amplitude waves match well with the corre-
sponding eKdV solutions, with errors in amplitude and phase speed below 10%.
For large waves with amplitudes approaching the maximum allowed by the eKdV
solution, the phase speed and the velocity profiles resemble the eKdV solution
while the wave profiles are distorted following the trough. This can potentially
be attributed to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities forming at the pycnocline. Larger
errors are generally observed when the local Richardson number at the JAW inlet
exceeds the threshold for instability.

1 Introduction

Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are observed in stratified ocean environments with
amplitudes greater than 100 m and wavelengths spanning several kilometers (Duda
et al. [1]). They can be excited by shear from tidal flows moving in opposite directions
or from interactions with underwater topography. The transport and breaking of ISWs
trigger vertical mixing of sediments, nutrients, and energy in the deep ocean. Trains of
ISWs have been captured by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) since the 1980s (Helfrich
and Melville [2]). With the development of in-situ thermistor arrays, the first time
series of ISWs were recorded in the early 2000’s (Duda et al. [1]).

ISWs propagate with permanent profiles as a result of the balance between non-
linear amplitude steepening and dispersive flattening (Cavaliere et al. [3]). As such,
ISWs have traditionally been described with nonlinear and dispersive wave equations,
most notably the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation. Among earlier developments,
KdV equations for ISWs under infinite depth were proposed by Benjamin [4] and
Ono [5]. The canonical model equations are derived from the complete Navier-Stokes
equations under the assumption of inviscid, incompressible, and density-stratified con-
ditions. However, the applicability of the KdV model is found to be restricted to
small-amplitude waves traveling in a system with a relatively small upper layer, as
demonstrated by Koop and Butler [6], Kao et al. [7] and Grue et al. [8]. For large-
amplitude waves, the KdV wave speed prediction is too fast and the wavelength is
too narrow compared with physical observations (Cavaliere et al. [3], Grue et al.
[8], Kodaira et al. [9]). A more suitable model for describing ISWs of larger ampli-
tudes is the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation, also known as the Gardner
equation (Djordjevic and Redekopp [10], Ostrovsky and Stepanyants [11]), wherein
the incorporation of a cubic nonlinearity better describes nonlinear broadening effects.
Derived in a similar manner, the modified Korteweg-de Vrie (mKdV) solution exam-
ines large-amplitude waves in a two-layer system; additional details of the derivation
will be given in Appendix A.

Experimental findings in the work of Michallet and Barthélemy [12] suggest that
while the mKdV solution can accurately describe large-amplitude waves in an immis-
cible two-layer system, its applicability to other general scenarios may be limited. In
order to address the nonlinear dynamics beyond the scope of the eKdV model, Choi
and Camasa [13] proposed an unsteady generalization of the steady long-wave model
of Miyata [14], known as the MCC model. This model assumes the wave amplitude
is comparable to the total depth and ISW wavelength is much greater than the total
depth. To assess the validity of the MCC model, ISW experiments were performed
in both miscible and immiscible systems. Kodaira et al. [9] has shown that the MCC
model with a free surface successfully predicts large-amplitude waves in an immiscible
two-layer system. Nevertheless, the eKdV solution is demonstrated to be more accu-
rate in a miscible two-layer system under small- to intermediate-amplitude waves by
Cavaliere et al. [3].

The generation of ISWs in two-layer systems has been investigated extensively over
the past five decades. Early efforts include a displacement-type mechanism, proposed
by Koop and Butler [6]. Subsequent work by Segur and Hammack [15] suggested a
plunger mechanism which prevented direct perturbation at the interface. Kao et al.

[7] introduced the gate-type mechanism, which enabled the successful generation of
a single soliton with a minimal trailing wave train. The invention of this gate-type
mechanism has enabled the comparison of the existing ISW theories (Kodaira et al.
[9], H. Michallet [16]) and the examination of wave-structure interactions (Chen et al.
[17], Cui et al. [18]).

However, the generation of ISWs using a gate-type mechanism has some inherent
limitations. First, since the primary control is the step-like volume of fluid behind the
gate, there is a degree of empiricism involved in the generation of waves of desired
amplitude. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, all comparisons between experimental
ISW measurements and theoretical predictions have thus far been made based on the
measured ISW amplitude, i.e., without a priori amplitude prediction. Second, the
extreme aspect ratio of the step-like initial volume behind the gate can cause the ISW
to break into multiple wave trains (Kao et al. [7]). Third, gate release experiments do
not allow for the evaluation of wave-wave interactions within a single release. Fourth,
the gate release can generate significant disturbances and mixing, leading to longer
lived transient effects.

To address these limitations, in this study, we extend the Jet-Array Wavemaker
(JAW) concept from Ko and Lynett [19] to ISW generation. The JAW system allows
for precise time-varying control of volumetric inputs and outputs at different depths.
This enables the generation of ISWs with prescribed velocity profiles. Moreover, it is
possible to generate multiple waves at desired intervals. This paper serves as proof-
of-concept for the generation of ISWs using the JAW system, evaluates best practices
for wave generation, and identifies potential sources of uncertainty and error.

All experiments are conducted in a miscible two-layer system comprising a fresh-
water layer on top of a salt solution layer. The eKdV solution is employed as the
reference function for driving the JAW system. Characteristics of the ISWs are cap-
tured by using a synchronized planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) and particle
imaging velocimetry (PIV) system. The measured wave profiles and velocity profiles
are compared with eKdV predictions to assess the performance of the JAW on ISW
generation. Appendix A shows the results obtained using the mKdV solution to force
the JAW system. The observed ISW displacements and velocity profiles show better
agreement with theory when using the eKdV solution.

The paper is organized as follows. The eKdV solution for generating the ISWs is
described in §2. The experimental set-up and the measurement systems are described
in §3. Potential sources of error for the jet-array wavemaker are discussed in §4. Mea-
sured wave profiles, phase speed, and velocity profiles are compared against theoretical
predictions in §5. Conclusions are presented in §6.

2.1 Extended Korteweg-de Vries Solution

Building upon the classical Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the extended
Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation, or Gardner equation, incorporates a cubic non-
linear term in the governing equation that captures the dynamics of large-amplitude

3 Experimental Facility and Techniques

3.1 Jet-Array Wavemaker

The method to generate ISWs was adapted from the Jet-Array Wavemaker (JAW)
configuration used by Ko and Lynett [19] to create single-fluid, free surface waves. The
layout of the system is given in Figure 1. Our system comprised two vertically-stacked
chambers, or baffles, at the inflow end of a wave flume. Each baffle was connected to an
independent fluid reservoir. The dimensions of the cylindrical reservoirs were 12 cm in
radius and 25 cm in height. Each reservoir was capped by a piston, which when moved
pushed fluid out or pulled fluid into the reservoir. The lower channel was connected
to the saltwater reservoir, and the upper channel to the freshwater. The flow from the
reservoirs, and thus the shape of the ISW, were controlled by the displacements of the
pistons, which were driven by Kollmorgen AKM44J servo motors. The servo motors
were controlled via a National Instruments USB 6009 data acquisition (DAQ) system
capable of multiple digital and analog inputs and outputs. The rotational speed and
direction of the motor were controlled by a temporal signal generated via MATLAB
in an open-loop control scheme.

The JAW system was connected to a wave flume of length 2.2 m, width 0.2 m, and
total height 0.45 m. The flume was constructed from clear acrylic sheets to allow for
optical access. There was a 1:7 slope with a height of 5 cm at the end of the flume to
force ISW breaking and dissipation with minimal reflection.

The layer volume flux was calculated by multiplying the targeted layer-averaged
velocity in Equation (8) by the cross-sectional area of the baffle. The servo motors
moved the pistons to match this volumetric flow rate. This is effectively a simple
conservation of mass, control-volume problem. To reduce the turbulence generated at
the inlet, two 5 cm-thick honeycomb structures were installed at the inlet in both
channels. Downstream of the honeycomb structure, a 5 cm long adjustable ramp was
hinged to the boundary separating the lower and the upper layers. The angle of the
ramp with respect to the horizontal was adjusted such that the downstream elevation
of the ramp matched the layer interface elevation.

3.2 Two-layer System

A miscible two-layer system was set up in the wave flume. The flume was first filled
with a salt solution to a depth of h2 with a uniform density of ρ2. The density of
the lower layer, ρ2, was set to be 1018±2 kg/m3. This was confirmed via multiple
measurements using a salinity probe. Freshwater with density of ρ1 = 998 kg/m3

(ρ1 < ρ2) was then introduced into the flume through two sponges floating on the free
surface of the saline lower layer until the total depth H = h1+h2 reached 11 cm. The
floating-sponge method minimized mixing between two layers, leading to a stratified
two-layer system with a small pycnocline ∆ζ.

For comparison purposes, Table 1 lists the wave parameters and generation mech-
anisms of ISWs in the present and previous studies. In this table, α = a/(h1 + h2) is

6



the dimensionless amplitude relative to the total depth, β = h1/h2 is the dimension-
less depth ratio, and ∆ = (ρ2 − ρ1)/ρ1 is the dimensionless density difference. While
most of the earlier studies were performed under a fixed depth ratio to investigate the
characteristics of ISWs, this study aims to test the efficacy of the JAW system across
a range of conditions. Thus, three nominal depth ratios, β = 1/10, 2/9, 3/8, were
chosen to examine a broader depth range than found in the previous works. For each
depth ratio, wave amplitudes starting from -1 cm (α = a/(h1 + h2) ≈ −0.091) up to
the amplitude limit predicted by eKdV theory were considered.

The constraints of the eKdV solution resulted in a smaller maximum α value in this
study than in previous research. The α and β values presented in Table 1 are plotted in
the parameter map shown in Figure 2. Black symbols denote the ten experimental runs
conducted in the present study. Gray symbols mark all the previous experimental cases
utilizing the gate-type mechanism. The red curve outlines the amplitude limitation of
eKdV solution, below which no eKdV ISW solution exists. The three black symbols
above α = −0.1 are referred to as small-amplitude cases, while the three black symbols
adjacent to the red curve are identified as large-amplitude cases. The cases positioned
in between are classified as intermediate-amplitude cases. As all ISWs in the present
study were generated based on eKdV theory, none of the black symbols fall below
the red curve. However, some cases in previous work did exceed the eKdV limitation
boundary. Their wave profiles either exhibited significant deviations from theoretical
predictions at the trailing edge (Cavaliere et al. [3], Grue et al. [8]) in miscible systems
or were potentially maintained by immiscibility (H. Michallet [16]).

3.3 Measurement Techniques

The generated ISWs were characterized by synchronizing planar laser-induced flu-
orescence (PLIF) and two-dimensional two-component particle imaging velocimetry
(2D-2C PIV), as shown in Figure 3. The PLIF and 2D-2C PIV systems were composed
of a 5W 532nm continuous laser and two CMOS Mako-U-130B 8-bit monochrome
cameras with 1024 × 1280 pixel resolution operated at 30Hz for 40s. The cameras
had an overlapping field-of-view of size 16 cm × 20 cm, positioned at least one wave-
length downstream from the inlet. This location minimized the impact of any initial
transients as well as wave reflection from the downstream end of the flume.

To separate the upper freshwater layer from the lower layer in PLIF, Rhodamine
6G dye with a peak excitation wavelength of 525nm and a peak emission wavelength
of 548nm was premixed with the freshwater to form a homogeneous mixture. The
fluorescent region was illuminated vertically by a laser sheet casting from the bottom
of the flume. The excited fluorescent region was then imaged using an optical filter
with a passband between 536 nm to 564 nm. Assuming single-pixel resolution for the
PLIF measurements, the dye field is resolved to approximately 0.16 mm.

Figure 4(a) shows a snapshot of the initial condition in the flume from a typical
configuration. A vertical slice of the brightness profile is normalized by its maximum
value as shown in Figure 4(b). Although the fluorescent fresh layer and the salt solution
exhibit homogeneity, the brightness within each layer does not remain uniform. There
are slight variations within the upper layer due to obstruction from PIV particles. In
the lower layer, light diffusion from above causes a descending brightness trend.

To estimate the pycnocline thickness, a hyperbolic tangent approximation proposed
by Benney [20] was fitted to the brightness profile:

B′(z) = B0 +B1 tanh

[
2

∆ζ
(z − ζ)

]
, (9)

where B0 is the normalized brightness at the pycnocline, B1 is a constant representing
the variation, and ∆ζ is the pycnocline thickness. To characterize the time-varying
wave profile, the vertical position corresponding to B′(z) = B0 was defined as the
pycnocline, or interface, across all frames. The upper and lower pycnocline boundaries
were assumed to be ζ ±∆ζ/2. The normalized brightness levels corresponding to the
upper and lower bounds of the pycnocline from the initial condition were used to
characterize pycnocline thickening. Measured pycnocline thicknesses varied between
0.1 to 0.8 cm (see Table 2 below). To characterize the deviation from the nominal
depth ratios, layer depths were measured for the initial condition using this brightness
profile. The measured layer depths h1,m and h2,m, were defined, respectively, from the
free surface to the interface (the location at which B′ = B0), and the interface to the
bottom of the flume.

To have PIV particles uniformly distributed across the entire two-layer system,
polyamide particles with a diameter of 55 µm were premixed into the fluorescent
fresh water solution. The seeding particles were introduced into the flume at the
time of the two-layer system creation. Particle-laden fluid was added through floating
sponges placed within and upstream of the region of interest to ensure the highest
seeding density for observation before and after ISW propagation. The salt solution
was also filtered through a 1 µm polypropylene cartridge filter to minimize the presence
of additional debris. The MATLAB PIVLab package was used to post-process the
images using a multi-pass algorithm. The initial pass involved a 64 pixel × 64 pixel
interrogation window. Two subsequent passes with 32 pixel × 32pixel interrogation
windows with 50% overlap yielded 69 × 44 velocity vectors per snapshot. Thus, the
PIV measurements have a spatial resolution of approximately 3 mm. Assuming an
uncertainty of 1 pixel per frame, the PIV measurements are resolved to roughly 4.8
mm/s. This estimate is conservative since the PIV algorithm resolves displacement
fields between image pairs at sub-pixel resolution.

4 Error Sources

4.1 Depth Ratio Mismatch

Creation of the layer depths in our two-layer system has a precision limit. Even with
very gradual injection rates, mixing between layers during the filling process and
subsequent sponge removal prevented layer depth precision below 3 mm. As a result,
the trials had a small mismatch between the actual layer depths and the nominal layer
depths. Since the nominal depths were used to drive the JAW and set the elevation of
the ramp at the upstream end of the flume, this depth mismatch could lead to wave
generation errors.

Fig. 5: Sensitivity contours showing volumetric differences due to discrepancies in
upper and lower layer depths for nominal depth values (h1, h2) = (2, 9) cm. The pan-
els show predictions for three different ISW amplitudes: (a) a = −1 cm, (b) a = −2
cm, (c) a = −2.5 cm. Panel (d) shows wave profiles for a = −2 cm. In (a-c), the square
markers represent the actual layer depths based on Table 2. In (d), the solid line shows
wave profiles for the ideal case (h1,m/h1, h2,m/h2) = (1, 1), the dashed line corre-
sponds to marker A in (b), with (h1,m/h1, h2,m/h2, ∆V/V0) = (0.86, 1.05,−0.15). The
dash-dotted line corresponds to marker B in (b) with (h1,m/h1, h2,m/h2, ∆V/V0) =
(1.13, 0.94, 0.21).

The impact of the depth ratio mismatch is characterized in the normalized volu-
metric difference contours, ∆V/V0 presented in Figure 5. Per the eKdV solution, the
velocities in each layer (and hence the fluid volume needed to produce ISWs of desired
amplitude) depend on the layer depths. As a result, there is a difference between the
volumetric flux used to drive the JAW system, which is calculated from the eKdV
solution for the nominal layer depths and desired amplitudes, and the volumetric flux
needed for the actual layer depths. This difference is defined as ∆V and normalized
by the nominal volumetric flux V0.

Fig. 6: Dye visualization of large amplitude wave generation at the inlet. The red solid
line shows flow direction of the upper layer fluid. The red dashed line shows entrained
upper layer fluid below the ramp.

Panels (a)-(c) in Figure 5 show the normalized volumetric difference for the nominal
depth ratio (h1, h2) = cm for small, intermediate, and large amplitude ISWs. These
volumetric differences are plotted as a function of the ratio between measured and
nominal layer depths h1,m/h1 and h2,m/h2. The red squares mark the measured values
in our experimental work. Brighter regions in the volumetric contours suggest smaller
variations in terms of the total volume required to form the wave, while the darker
region suggests larger variations.

For the small amplitude case shown in Figure 5(a), the vertical alignment of the
contours suggests that the volumetric differences are primarily driven by the variations
in the upper layer depth; the lower layer has a negligible effect. For the intermediate
amplitude case in Figure 5(b), variations in both layers have comparable impacts. For
the large-amplitude case shown in Figure 5(c), the contours are primarily oriented in
the horizontal direction, which implies that the volumetric differences are sensitive to
the lower layer discrepancies. The blank region in the lower half of Figure 5(c) shows
the area where no solutions exist according to the eKdV theory.

Figure 5(d) shows wave profiles corresponding to the conditions marked in Figure
5(b). The black solid line depicts the profile with no discrepancies in either layer,
while the other profiles represent points with volumetric differences larger than 10%.
Thus, the depth ratio mismatch can lead to either broadening or narrowing of the
wave profiles.

For all the experimental results shown in this paper, the mismatch between nominal
and actual layer depths resulted in volumetric differences below 10%. As a result, a 10%
amplitude error is adopted as a quantitative criterion for successful ISW generation.

4.2 Wave Generation Errors

Figure 6 captures the inlet condition as the main depression wave of an ISW departs
from the adjustable ramp through dye visualization. For the intermediate and large
amplitude cases, there are stronger descending motions of the pycnocline and stronger
suction forces from the lower channel. Some upper layer fluid is therefore entrained
into the lower layer just below the ramp as shown in Figure 6. This leads to an upper

layer volume deficit in the measured trough of the ISW, which is balanced by an upper
layer volume excess on the trailing side of the ISW and in the oscillatory tail (i.e., in
any trailing waves). Throughout this manuscript, the term leading side is used to refer
to the wave front ahead of the trough (i.e., point of maximum depression). Trailing
side is used to refer to the back side of the wave, i.e., after the passage of the trough.

Figure 7(a) shows dye visualization at the inlet for a small amplitude ISW. An
interfacial instability can be observed at the end of the adjustable ramp due to the
interaction between the jets and the geometry. However, the mixing due to this insta-
bility is confined to the inlet region and does not propagate with the ISW. Hence, a
sharp pycnocline is observed on the trailing side of the ISW, as illustrated in Figure
7(c).

Figure 7(b) shows dye visualization of the inlet condition for a large amplitude ISW.
In this case, the larger velocity gradient across the pycnocline leads to a sustained shear
driven Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) type instability at the pycnocline. This KH instability
triggers mixing between the lower and upper layers on the trailing side of the wave
leading to a thickened pycnocline as shown in Figure 7(d). A similar trend was observed
in the two-layer system studied by Kodaira et al. [9], though the interface remained
distinct due to immiscibility.

5 Results

5.1 Wave Profiles

Table 2 summarizes the parameters for the ten ISW experiments conducted. In this
table, h1, h2, and a are the nominal values used to generate the eKdV solution for
the JAW, while h1,m, h2,m and am are the values measured using PLIF. The mea-
sured amplitude, am, is determined by calculating the difference between the mean
stationary pycnocline position before wave arrival and the maximum displacement of
the pycnocline under the wave trough. Corresponding time series of the wave profiles
are provided in Figure 8. The shaded red envelopes surrounding the measured profiles
mark the pycnocline thicknesses as defined in Section 3.3.

The pycnocline thickness at t = −10 s characterizes the initial condition for each
trial. Subsequent variation in pycnocline thickness captures the mixing dynamics as the
ISW propagates. The measured profiles are generally composed of a main depression
wave and an oscillatory tail caused by the mismatch between the theory and nature.
The wave front appearing before t = 0 s is termed the leading side. The portion
appearing after the passage of the trough at t = 0 s is termed the trailing side of the
wave.

In all cases, small-scale (< 1mm) disturbances can be observed in Figure 8 prior
to the main depression wave due to small-amplitude and short-wavelength free surface
gravity waves created during ISW generation. Similar disturbances can be found in the
experiments of Kodaira et al. [9] and H. Michallet [16], but caused by the gate-lifting
motion and wave reflection from the end wall. In the small and intermediate amplitude
cases shown in Figure 8 (a,d-f,h), the measured wave profiles are closely aligned with
the eKdV solutions. The amplitude of the oscillatory tail after the main depression
waves is generally within 1 mm. Furthermore, there is negligible temporal variation in
pycnocline thickness, suggesting minimal entrainment across the pycnocline.

However, for large amplitude cases shown in Figure 8 (c,g,i-j), the measured wave
profiles significantly deviate from the dashed black curve predicted based on the nom-
inal values, and instead follow the solid black curve predicted using measured values.
This can potentially be attributed to the depth ratio mismatch discussed in Section
4.1; for the large amplitude cases, the wave amplitude and volumetric flux are sensi-
tive to minor variations in layer depths. Note that no solid curves are shown in Figure
8(g,j) as the measured amplitudes exceed the eKdV solution limits. The measured
profiles for these two cases show reasonable agreement with the black dashed curves
predicted using nominal values, except in the vicinity of the wave trough where the
measured amplitude is greater. This suggests that the eKdV solution captures ISW
physics in miscible two-layer systems reasonably well near the amplitude limit.

The interfacial instability shown in Figure 7(b) for large amplitude waves causes
the amplitude of the oscillatory tail in Figure 8 (c,g,i-j) to increase to approximately
5 mm. Additionally, the pycnocline thickening illustrated in Figure 7(d) is evident on
the trailing side of the ISW. Similar mixing processes starting from the trailing side
of the ISW were shown in the miscible two-layer systems of Grue et al. [8].

In Figure 8 (b,c), the measured wave profiles exhibit a slow return to the initial
interface elevation after the wave has passed. The upper layer fluid volume required
to form ISWs for the (h1, h2) = (1cm, 10cm) depth ratio is relatively small, i.e., the
small upper layer depth translates into lower volumetric requirements for the JAW.
As a result, any entrainment at the inlet, as shown in Figure 6, can alter the wave
profiles significantly. For the large amplitude case shown in Figure 8(c), the effect of
this trapped volume couples with KH instability, leading to a significant dispersion on
the trailing side of the ISW. This is the only large amplitude case with a measured
amplitude under the nominal value.

5.2 Amplitude and Phase Speed Errors

The amplitude error is quantified as the relative difference between the measured and
the nominal amplitude values: ϵa = (am − a)/a. Table 3 shows that for small and

Table 3: Amplitude and phase speed errors and Richardson num-
ber estimates. Here, ϵa is the amplitude error measured at the ISW
trough, ∂u/∂z is the nominal shear at the inlet, Ri is the corre-
sponding Richardson number estimate, c is the phase speeds of the
ISWs calculated based on the nominal eKdV solution, cm is the
measured phase speed, and ϵc is the phase speed error.

intermediate amplitudes, cases 1, 2, 4-6, and 8, amplitude errors are maintained below
10%. Higher errors are primarily observed for the large amplitude cases (3, 7, 9, 10).
As noted earlier, these cases exhibited a KH type instability startinf from the inlet.

Since the instability occurs when the destabilizing effect of the interfacial shear
outweighs the stabilizing effect of the density gradient at the pycnocline, we can use
a Richardson number evaluated near the inlet to indicate its likelihood:

Ri =
(−g/ρ2)(∂ρ/∂z)

(∂u/∂z)2
=

(−g/ρ2) [(ρ2 − ρ1)/∆ζ]

[(u1 − u2)/d]
2 . (10)

Here u1 and u2 are the theoretical layer-averaged horizontal velocity components cal-
culated from Equation (8) based on the nominal values, and d = 0.5 cm is the thickness
of the inclined ramp separating the two inlet channels. The pycnocline thickness, ∆ζ,
and the layer densities, ρ1 and ρ2, can be obtained from Table 2. According to Grue
et al. [8], the stability criteria for a stratified parallel flow is that the Richardson
number should be greater than 0.25.

The small and intermediate amplitude cases with low amplitude errors have inlet
Richardson numbers above 0.25 due to relatively small ∂u/∂z values, as shown in
Table 3. Conversely, for large amplitudes, cases 3, 7, and 10, the Richardson number
falls below 0.25 and the amplitude error exceeds 10%. In case 9, the amplitude error is
above 10% despite its Richardson number above 0.25, suggesting that the depth ratio
mismatch could also be a contributing factor.

The phase speed error is quantified as the relative difference between the measured
phase speed and the predicted phase speed calculated from Equation (6) based on the
nominal values: ϵc = (cm − c)/c. The measured phase speed, cm, is determined by
measuring trough arrival time between two different locations spaced 12.5 cm apart
in the PLIF field of view. For a frame rate of 30 Hz and the spatial resolution of the
images, the uncertainty in the measured phase speed is estimated to be roughly 5

16



mm/s. As shown in Table 3, the phase speed errors remain within the margin of this
uncertainty across all amplitude conditions. Notably, positive phase speed errors are
observed only in the large amplitude cases when the Richardson number drops below
0.25. The phase speed for the large amplitude ISWs may increase due to additional
volume entrainment causing an increase in wave amplitude. Indeed cases 7 and 10 both
show an increase in wave amplitude relative to the nominal value and a corresponding
increase in wave speed. However, for case 3, the measured wave amplitude is lower
than the nominal value yet the phase speed is higher.

5.3 Velocity Profiles

The horizontal velocity profiles shown in Figure 9 are extracted from PIV data at the
ISW trough. Since the PLIF and PIV are captured synchronously, the PIV-derived
velocity profiles are extracted at the time of maximum displacement determined using
the PLIF measurement. The red dots in Figure 9 show the horizontal velocity averaged
across a window 6 cm wide in the horizontal direction. The red shaded regions show
one standard deviation.

Despite implementing the floating sponge method to uniformly distribute PIV par-
ticles, the uppermost layer remained insufficiently seeded in some of the cases. During
the establishment of the two-layer system, the sponges submerged roughly 1 cm as
they absorb water, causing the release of particles only beneath a certain depth. These
low-seeding regions are shown using gray shading, where the PIV measurements either
go to zero or show significantly larger variability. Note that the impact of low seeding
is most pronounced for the cases with thin upper layers or for large amplitude waves
which lead to a larger downward displacement of the interface. Indeed, for the depth
ratio of h1/h2 = 1cm/10cm, the entire upper layer experiences insufficient seeding.
This low seeding region is displaced downwards by the ISWs, yielding unreliable PIV
measurements in the entire upper layer as observed in Figure 9(a-c).

As expected, the observed horizontal velocities align with the direction of the wave
propagation above the pycnocline and move in the opposite direction below the pycn-
ocline. Moreover, since the lower layer is thicker in all cases, the horizontal velocity in
the lower layer is always smaller than that in the upper layer. The measured horizon-
tal velocity profiles are compared with the layer-averaged velocity profiles predicted
by the eKdV model, considering both nominal and measured values.

The measured velocity profiled generally show good agreement with the eKdV
predictions in both the lower and upper layers (except for the cases with h1 = 1 cm
where the entire upper layer has insufficient seeding). Differences in predicted velocities
using nominal or measured parameters are not significant.

In all cases, the measured horizontal velocity in the lower layer are nearly uniform.
As expected, some of the the profiles show the emergence of a thin viscous boundary
layer at the bottom wall. Moreover, the standard deviation in the velocity measure-
ments is small, indicating spatial uniformity. For the small and intermediate amplitude
cases, the high-shear region between the (nearly uniform) upper and lower layers has
a vertical extent of ∼ 1 cm, as shown in Figure 9(d-f),(h). For the large amplitude
cases, however, the vertical transition distance expands to ∼1.5-2 cm as illustrated in
Figure 9(g),(j). This expansion is consistent with the observed pycnocline thickening,

and can potentially be attributed to the mixing induced by KH vortices. Moreover,
the upper layer velocities exceed the theoretical prediction by approximately 0.5 cm/s.
This is consistent with the observed increase in wave amplitude. However, it must be
noted that these small differences in velocity are of the same order of magnitude as
the observed variability and the expected PIV uncertainty. Despite the presence of KH
instabilities in large amplitude cases, the structure of ISWs in the lower layer remains
intact. This is evidenced by the consistent matching of velocity profiles in the lower
layer.

6 Conclusions

Internal solitary waves generated by the jet-array wave maker have been experimen-
tally investigated in miscible two-layer systems. Prior work by Cavaliere et al. [3]
suggests that, for a miscible two-layer system, the weakly nonlinear eKdV solution
yields good agreement with measurements. Thus, the eKdV solution is selected as the
reference for wave generation in the JAW system.

The results presented in this study show that the JAW system can predictably
generate ISWs in miscible two-layer systems with varying depth ratios and wave ampli-
tudes up to the eKdV solution limit. Moreover, the generated waves show displacement
profiles consistent with theoretical predictions within roughly one wavelength of the
inlet. Given that minimal mixing is inevitable during the construction process of the
two-layer system, discrepancies in depth ratios are identified as potential sources of
error. Volumetric sensitivity tests reveal that small amplitude cases are more sensitive

19



to the mismatch in the upper layer depth, while large amplitude cases are more sen-
sitive to the mismatch in the lower layer depth. The absolute volumetric differences
were kept below 10% in all cases to minimize the impact of layer depth mismatch. This
effect coupled with pycnocline thickening due to mixing generally led to amplitude
errors less than 10%.

Dye visualization revealed the possibility of wave-generation errors taking place
around inlets. For the ISWs with narrow profiles (i.e., the waves with the largest
temporal gradients in velocity and pressure at the inlet), the wave can be altered
significantly because of flow short-circuiting around the inlet ramp. Due to a suction
force in the lower channel, some upper-layer fluid is entrained into the lower layer
just below the ramp. In small- and intermediate amplitude cases, instabilities are
formed during generation by the interaction between the flow and the geometry in
the JAW system. This generational instability is confined near the inlet with minimal
influence on the wave formation. Sharpness at the leading side is preserved as the ISW
propagates downstream. The measured time series agrees with the analytic solution
with minimal oscillation after the main depression wave.

As the velocity gradient increases with ISW amplitude a sustained KH-type insta-
bility is observed at the interface as the wave propagates. KH instabilities overcome the
stability provided by density gradients in the large-amplitude cases, triggering mix-
ing across the pycnocline on the trailing side. This additional mixing is thought to be
responsible for errors larger than 10% observed in certain cases. For these cases, larger
oscillatory motions left behind by the KH instability and a thickened pycnocline are
observed after the main depression wave. Similar instabilities have been documented
in prior studies on miscible two-layer ISWs experiments (Kao et al. [7], Grue et al.
[8]). Local Richardson numbers were estimated around the inlet, where the instabil-
ity initiates. Increasing amplitude errors and the positive phase speed errors roughly
agree with the stability threshold of Ri = 0.25 for stratified parallel flows. Despite the
varying amplitude errors, the measured phase speed errors are kept within the margin
of uncertainty for all cases.

Through PIV data, we find that the horizontal velocity profiles at the wave trough
show strong agreement with the layer-averaged velocity profiles derived from the eKdV
solution for small- and intermediate-amplitude cases. Within each layer, the horizontal
velocity components remain nearly constant over depth.

For large-amplitude cases, the shear layer between layers broadens as the pycno-
cline thickness increases due to the aforementioned KH instability. ISWs with larger
amplitude errors induced by KH instabilities result in measured velocities in the upper
layer that are at least 0.5 cm/s higher than the eKdV predictions. Conversely, the
measured velocities in the lower layer remain well-aligned with the eKdV predic-
tions, suggesting that the deeper lower layers are potentially less impacted by the
instabilities.

The strengths and limitations of the JAW system are studied in this work. Previous
experimental work has primarily relied on gate release mechanisms to generate ISWs
(Cavaliere et al. [3], Kao et al. [7], Grue et al. [8], Kodaira et al. [9], H. Michallet [16]).

Yet, it is unclear which of the eKdV, mKdV, or MCC solutions best captures the
measurements. By enabling the generation of ISWs with the theoretically-predicted

20



excitation, the JAW system allows for a direct comparison between theory and exper-
iment. Indeed, the results presented in Appendix A show that the use of the mKdV
solution leads to greater discrepancies between the measured profiles and theoretical
predictions.

The quality of the ISWs generated by JAW is shown to be comparable with those
observed in gate release experiments. Additionally, the JAW system allows for a pri-
ori amplitude and wave profile selection as well as the generation of multiple solitary
waves, periodic internal waves, and surface waves (Ko and Lynett [19]). Moving for-
ward, this could enable novel wave-structure (Chen et al. [17], Cui et al. [18], Michallet
and Ivey [21]) and wave-wave interaction experiments.

Appendix A The Internal Solitary Waves in
mKdV Solutions

The modified Korteweg deVries (mKdV) solution relies on the same governing
equations as the eKdV solution of Equation (1) but uses the transformation of ζ

=

ζ − 2c1/c2 and the assumption of c1 → 0 (Michallet and Barthélemy [12], H. Michal-
let [16], Cui et al. [18], Funakoshi and Oikawa [22], Apel et al. [23]). This potentially
allows for larger density differences, wave amplitudes, and critical depth ratios. The
mKdV solution is expressed by

ζ(x, t) = a

Two cases with the mKdV profiles — for depth ratio h1/h2 = 2cm/9cm and ampli-
tudes a = −1 cm and a = −1.5 cm — are investigated to verify the applicability of
mKdV solution in the JAW system (see Section 3). Because of the assumptions of a
negligible c1 term, the dispersion is solely balanced by linear and cubic nonlinearities,
resulting in broader wave profiles in the mKdV solution compared to the eKdV solu-
tion. In the small-amplitude case as shown in Figure A1(a), while the amplitude error
remains below 10%, which is comparable to that for the eKdV solutions. However,
the phase speed error exceeds 10%. Moreover, the excessive volume predicted by the
mKdV solution develops into an asymmetric trailing edge after the trough.

Fig. A2: Comparison between experimental and theoretical velocity profiles at the
troughs and the measured shear for mKdV profiles at the depth ratio of h1/h2 =
2cm/9cm for amplitudes a = −1 cm (a) and a = −1.5 cm (b). Red shaded regions
show measurements within one standard deviation. Gray shading represents regions
without sufficient particles for PIV. Black dashed lines show mKdV predictions based
on nominal values. Black solid lines show mKdV predictions based on measured values.
Blue sold lines show shear derived from PIV measurements.

As the amplitude increases to a = 1.5cm, the larger excessive volume leads to
further broadening of the wave profile as observed in Figure A1(b) along with a 14
% amplitude growth. The approximately 20% increase in the phase speed leads to
stronger shear, triggering instabilities and oscillatory tail. The wave profiles of the
eKdV solution under the same layer depths and amplitudes are presented in Figure
8(d, e). Both profiles closely align with the predictions derived from the eKdV solution.

The corresponding horizontal velocity profiles at the troughs are presented in
Figure A2. The velocity profiles match the mKdV solution in the lower layer, whereas
the excessive volumetric forcing leads to enhanced velocity profiles in the upper layer.
The mKdV solution also leads to less uniform velocity profiles in the upper layer dur-
ing wave propagation compared to the almost-constant profiles shown in Figure 9 for
the eKdV solution.

As noted in Michallet and Barthélemy [12], the applicability range of the mKdV
solution is limited. The assumption of vanishing c1 term confines its existence only to
critical depth ratios of h1/h2 ≈ 1 in miscible two-layer systems or more reasonable
depth ratios in immiscible systems with larger density differences. This study exam-
ines two preliminary cases of mKdV solution, each sharing identical depth ratios and
amplitudes as the eKdV solution detailed in Section 5. Subsequent analysis demon-
strates that the eKdV model has a better representation of the ISWs within miscible
two-layer systems than does the mKdV model.
