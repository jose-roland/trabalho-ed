Abstract

Background: The circadian rhythm aligns physiology and behaviour with the 24-hour light-dark

cycle, and its disruption is linked to neurological disorders such as epilepsy. However, how to best

quantify circadian disruption remains unclear, as it can manifest across various properties and

timescales. A promising but under-explored approach is to assess the intra-individual variability

in circadian rhythms over timescales of weeks to years. This is yet to be studied in epilepsy.

Methods: We retrospectively used wearable smartwatch data (Fitbit) from 143 people with

epilepsy (PWE) and 31 controls. For each participant, we extracted the circadian oscillation un-

derlying their heart rate time series and analysed the intra-individual variability of three circadian

properties: period, acrophase, and amplitude.

Findings: We found increased intra-individual variability in period (77 min vs. 62 min,

z = 3.32, p < 0.001) and acrophase (68 min vs. 54 min, z = 2.97, p = 0.003) for PWE compared

to controls, but not in amplitude (1.98 bpm vs. 2.05 bpm, z = −0.66, p = 0.51). For PWE, we did

not find any correlations between seizure frequency and intra-individual variability in circadian

properties, or any difference between weeks with and without seizures.

Interpretation: This finding indicates that the circadian rhythm of heart rate is more variable

for people with epilepsy and that this can be detected using a wearable device. However, we were

unable to find any associations with seizure frequency or occurrence, suggesting intra-individual

variability could be another manifestation of epilepsy aetiology. Future work should investigate the

combined role of anti-seizure medications, demographics, co-morbidities, and health behaviours in

driving the increased intra-individual variability of circadian properties in epilepsy.

1 Introduction

The circadian rhythm aligns our physiology and behaviour to the 24-hour environmental light-dark

cycle. A stable circadian rhythm is thought to be important for overall health, and disruptions

to the circadian rhythm have been associated with various conditions, including sleep disorders

(Burgess et al., 2017; Fishbein et al., 2021), psychiatric disorders (Ali et al., 2023; Carr, 2018; Song

et al., 2024), and neurological disorders (Logan and McClung, 2019). However, it remains unclear

how circadian disruption should be assessed over the long term, with different suggestions across

different contexts (Asgari-Targhi and Klerman, 2019; Vetter, 2018).

One promising and easy-to-interpret approach is to assess the intra-individual variability of

some circadian rhythm properties, such as amplitude, measured across multiple days. This ap-

proach has also been referred to as ‘day-to-day variability’ (Fossion et al., 2017; Garćıa-Iglesias

et al., 2023) or ‘circadian variability’ Carr (2018). Intra-individual variability is designed to de-

tect persistent irregularities in circadian rhythms over long-term physiological recordings. Such

data are most easily obtained from peripheral measures using wearable devices (such as heart

rate, physical activity, and skin temperature), making this approach a cost-effective and scalable

methodology to study circadian disruption, complementary with existing methods.

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures (Devinsky et al., 2018),

which are influenced by sleep patterns (Bazil, 2003; Degen, 1980; Dell’Aquila and Soti, 2022; Derry

and Duncan, 2013; Grayson and DeWolfe, 2018) and the circadian rhythm (Bazhanova, 2022; Gas-

coigne et al., 2023; Hofstra and de Weerd, 2009; Karoly et al., 2021; Stirling et al., 2023; Thornton

et al., 2024). However, the impact of persistent, long-term circadian disruption on epilepsy remains

unstudied. We propose using an intra-individual variability assessment on data from people with

epilepsy (PWE), which could provide valuable insights for clinical applications, such as enhancing

wearable seizure prediction and guiding chronotherapeutic treatments (Bazhanova, 2022), includ-

ing ASM alert systems. Additionally, demonstrating the effectiveness of variability in circadian

patterns as a measure of disruption in epilepsy could support its broader use as a clinical biomarker

in wearable devices.

Here, we measure the intra-individual variability of three descriptive properties of the circadian

3



rhythm of heart rate (CRHR) using long-term wearable-derived heart rate recordings from 143

PWE and 31 controls. We seek to establish whether variability is greater in epilepsy and, if so,

whether a relationship exists between variability and seizure frequency and occurrence.

2 Methods

2.1 Participant Data

Wearable smartwatch data from people with epilepsy (PWE) and controls were used retrospec-

tively, sourced from the observational “Tracking Seizure Cycles” study (Karoly et al., 2021). Adults

with epilepsy were recruited to this study by referral from collaborating epilepsy specialists in

tertiary referral epilepsy clinics. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of epilepsy from a specialised

epileptologist, uncontrolled/partially controlled seizures as determined by their neurologist, and

that they were deemed capable of keeping a reliable seizure diary. Additionally, Karoly et al. (2021)

recruited control participants without epilepsy from their colleagues, friends and relatives, with

no randomisation or blinding performed. Their study was approved by the St Vincent’s Hospital

Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 009.19). All participants provided written informed

consent.

For both PWE and controls, data were collected via a wearable smartwatch (Fitbit), continu-

ously measuring heart rate via photoplethysmography (PPG) at 5 s resolution. PWE participating

also used a mobile device to manually report clinically-apparent seizures using the freely-available

Seer App for either the entirety, or a subset of, the study period.

Before processing, data was available for n=164 PWE and n=36 controls.

Our retrospective analysis of this data was approved by the Newcastle University Ethics Com-

mittee (40679/2023).

Figure 1: An illustrative schematic of one ‘cycle’ of the circadian rhythm of heart rate (CRHR) with
the 3 descriptive properties used in this study labelled. Period reflects the duration of one cycle of
the modelled CRHR (approximately 24 hours). Acrophase is defined as the time-of-day at peak cycle
magnitude, reflecting rhythm ‘timing’. Amplitude is a measure of circadian ‘strength’, defined as the
difference in magnitude between cycle peak and previous trough.

2.2 Measuring circadian disruption using physiological time-series: the

‘intra-individual variability’ approach

Capturing the intra-individual variability of the circadian rhythm involves the daily measurement

of three descriptive circadian properties, which are illustrated in Figure 1. For each participant,

the circadian rhythm of heart rate (CRHR) was extracted from their wearable recording. Three

circadian properties were then computed for each daily cycle in the CRHR. Finally, estimates of

the average (statistical mean) and variability (statistical standard deviation) of each property over

the recording were produced. Figure 2 provides an overview of this process, and further details

are provided below and in Supplementary S1.

2.2.1 Accounting for gaps in recording

To calculate the circadian properties of the heart rate, a continuous signal was required. Any

gaps shorter than 8 hours were linearly interpolated, and the signal was split up into ‘runs’ of data

5



between remaining gaps (Figure 2B). 26 participants (21 PWE, 5 control) without any ‘runs’ longer

than 7 days were excluded from further analysis. A more detailed explanation and justification for

this approach is provided in Supplementary S1.3.

2.2.2 Extracting the circadian rhythm

For each ‘run’ of data, singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was applied to decompose the continu-

ous raw heart-rate time series into components of distinct frequency (Figure 2C-E(i)). SSA was

found to be the best-performing algorithm from a set of similar methods (see Supplementary S1.1).

To determine which component represented the CRHR, Fourier analysis was performed on each

component to determine its central frequency. The component with period (inverse of frequency)

closest to 24 hours was selected as the circadian component (Figure 2E(i)).

2.2.3 Computing circadian properties

The extracted CRHR was then split-up into the individual (approximately daily) circadian cycles

(Figure 2E), and the period, acrophase and amplitude were computed for each cycle (Figure 2G).

To achieve this, the Hilbert transform was applied to the extracted CRHR, producing a complex-

valued analytic signal, from which the circadian “phase series” (Supplementary S1.2), a measure

of circadian cycle progression, was derived (Figure 2E(ii)). The rhythm was then split into daily

cycles at each trough in the phase-series. For each individual cycle, period was computed from the

duration between the first and last time point of the cycle, acrophase as the time of day at zero

cycle phase, and amplitude as the difference between magnitude at acrophase and trough (Figure 1).

2.2.4 Calculating the intra-individual variability of circadian properties

Circadian properties for each cycle were grouped into consecutive, non-overlapping segments of

seven days. The standard deviation was calculated across all seven days in each segment and

property (Figure 2G), and the summary intra-individual variability was calculated from the average

6



of the standard deviations across all segments. The intra-individual average of circadian properties,

only used for reference later, was calculated in the same way from the average of the means across

segments. The fixed segment size of seven days prevents any bias introduced by varying recording

duration and ‘run’ length between participants when calculating the mean and standard deviation

(see Supplementary S1.3 for more detail).

2.3 Statistical Analysis

We calculate p-values for reference only, and all reported values are raw, uncorrected by FDR. A

two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the intra-individual average and variability

of each circadian property between PWE and controls. To account for the imbalance between PWE

and control sample sizes, a random sub-sampling test was performed over 10,000 iterations where

the whole control sample was compared to a random sub-sample of 28 PWE using the same

statistical method as above. Sampling was without replacement within an iteration, but with

replacement across iterations.

Pearson’s correlation was used to test whether an individual’s seizure frequency was correlated

with their intra-individual variability calculated over segments occurring between the start and end

of their seizure diary. Seizure frequency was defined in terms of the average number of seizures per

week of recording data post-segmenting. The distribution of seizure frequency was highly skewed,

so a log10 transformation was applied for the correlation analysis.

To test whether having one or more seizures in a seven-day period was associated with greater

intra-individual variability, we classified each 7-day segment as either seizure-containing or seizure-

free according to the seizure diary. We then calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from the

receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to compare the variability distributions in seizure-

containing versus seizure-free segments for each individual. The AUC score indicates the separa-

bility of these two distributions: a value of 0.5 shows no difference in variability between seizure-

containing and seizure-free weeks, values from 0.5 to 1.0 suggest higher variability in seizure-

containing weeks, and values from 0 to 0.5 indicate greater variability in seizure-free weeks. Thus,

each circadian property yields a single AUC value, representing its association with seizure activity.

Figure 2: Participant heart rate data (A) was split into runs between >8h gaps of missing data (B).
SSA extracted the CRHR from each run (C to E(i)). Troughs in the circadian phase (E(ii)) were used
as reference points for splitting the extracted CRHR into individual cycles. Circadian properties were
calculated for each cycle and grouped into segments of seven days (G). The mean and standard deviation
of each property was then calculated within each 7-day segment. The mean across all segments in a
subject produces the final intra-individual average and variability values. The intra-individual variability
of acrophase across the two example segments would be (34 + 59)/2 = 46.5 minutes.

3 Results

143 people with epilepsy (PWE) and 31 controls remained after processing. Table 1 lists the

demographics and other metadata of this cohort. An average of 163 hours (sd = 183) were discarded

for each subject, resulting in an average recording duration of 443.9 days (sd = 530.9) for PWE

and 221.7 days (sd = 257.0) for controls. There was no relationship between (post-segmenting)

recording duration and intra-individual variability in any circadian property (Supplementary S2).

There were no age (t = −0.215, p = 0.84) or sex (χ2 = 2.777, p = 0.427) differences between PWE

and controls, and there was no association between intra-individual variability in any circadian

property and age or sex (see Supplementary S4).

pared between PWE and controls using the independent two-sided Welch’s t-Test. Sex comparison was
performed using the Chi-square test of independence. Duration comparison was performed using the
two-sided Mann-Whitney U test.

3.1 The circadian rhythm of heart rate is more variable for people

with epilepsy

The intra-individual variability in period (77min vs. 62 min, z = 3.32, p < 0.001) and acrophase

(68 min vs. 54 min, z = 2.97, p < 0.001) was increased for PWE compared to controls (Figure 3).

9



However, there was no difference in intra-individual variability of amplitude between PWE and

controls (∼2bpm, z = −0.66, p = 0.51).

For reference, we also present the results for intra-individual average in Figure 3, but found

no substantial difference between PWE and controls (period: z = 0.36, p = 0.72; acrophase:

z = 0.95, p = 0.34; amplitude: z = −1.52, p = 0.13).

All results held after applying random sub-sampling to equal numbers of PWE and controls

(see Supplementary S3).

3.2 Intra-individual variability of circadian properties does not corre-

late with increased seizure frequency

Next, the correlation between seizure frequency and intra-individual variability was investigated.

PWE without seizures recorded, or with outlying intra-individual variability (absolute z-score >

3) in any property were removed. We found that intra-individual variability was not correlated

with seizure frequency (R2 << 0.1).

3.3 The intra-individual variability of circadian properties does not

differ between weeks with and without seizures

Finally, we investigated whether either seizure-containing or seizure-free weeks contributed more to

intra-individual variability of circadian properties. An AUC was calculated between variability in

seizure-containing and seizure-free weeks for each property, resulting in three AUC values (period,

acrophase, amplitude) for each participant. Figure 5A shows the AUCs and the distributions

they were calculated from for an example participant. Figure 5B shows the AUC values for each

property across all participants. The distributions are centered around 0.5 indicating that, at the

population level, the circadian period, acrophase and amplitude variability does not differ in weeks

where seizures occur.

4 Discussion

This study analysed the intra-individual variability in three properties of the circadian rhythm

using long-term wearable heart rate data from 143 PWE and 31 controls. We found an increased

variability in circadian period and acrophase for PWE, providing initial evidence of circadian

disruption in epilepsy. However, we found no evidence of an association between intra-individual

variability and seizure frequency, or occurrence at the population level.

Circadian disruption has a bi-directional relationship with health (Abbott et al., 2020) and

is associated with mortality over the long term (Zuurbier et al., 2014). It is therefore likely to

have compounding health implications for PWE, so the results presented here should motivate the

development of interventions to reduce the co-morbidities associated with circadian disruption in

PWE (Latreille et al., 2018).

We found no evidence of any link with seizures but consider a link with epilepsy aetiology

possible. Evidence from ex vivo tissue (Wu et al., 2021), and intracranial EEG (Thornton et al.,

2024) indicates that tissue associated with epilepsy pathology may have an impaired circadian

‘clock’, which could also have downstream effects on the expression of the circadian rhythm in

heart rate. Co-morbidities of epilepsy such as anxiety and depression (Keezer et al., 2016; Leidy

et al., 1999) are also themselves associated with circadian disruption (Walker et al., 2020), and

so also may contribute to the observed difference. Within the epilepsy cohort we found that

intra-individual variability has a wide range and considerable overlap with the control distribution.

Future work should investigate the extent to which the co-morbidities mentioned above can explain

these findings.

Our approach has some key limitations. Firstly, while heart rate follows a strong circadian

cycle (Vandewalle et al., 2007), bouts of activity such as exercise or stress can cause ‘behavioural

masking’, interfering with measurement of the circadian state (Cui et al., 2023). Secondly, our

analysis does not include some key variables that may play a role in the intra-individual variability

we observe. Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) have been reported to both stabilise and disrupt

sleep (Bazil, 2003; Derry and Duncan, 2013), and so could explain the increased intra-individual

variability we see in PWE as well as variability between subjects. Demographics such as age and

14



sex are also known to associate with circadian parameters (Logan and McClung, 2019; Natarajan

et al., 2020). We did observe a correlation between age and intra-individual averages of acrophase

and amplitude as expected based on previous literature, but not with variability in any property.

We did not find any sex differences with respect to circadian average or variability. Despite

the noise- and accuracy-associated problems of wearable measures (such as PPG-derived heart

rate), their clinical ubiquity and relative convenience arguably justifies their usage in this context.

Future work should take advantage of multi-modal wearables, integrating heart rate with activity

and temperature for circadian state estimation, for example.

y, the role of sleep disruption in epilepsy is well noted (Bazhanova, 2022; Daley and DeWolfe,

2018; Derry and Duncan, 2013; Foldvary-Schaefer and Grigg-Damberger, 2006; Grayson and De-

Wolfe, 2018; Hofstra and de Weerd, 2009; Touchon et al., 1991), and while a distinct process

physiologically (Hofstra and de Weerd, 2009; Meyer et al., 2022; Vetter, 2018), it is intrinsically

tied to the circadian rhythm. As the circadian behaviour of heart rate is tied to sleep, its variability

may primarily driven by sleep disruptions. Future studies should incorporate sleep quality ques-

tionnaires and wearable sleep tracking to distinguish between sleep-related variability vs. more

broad intra-individual variability of the circadian rhythm.

In conclusion, we found increased variability of the circadian rhythm of heart rate in epilepsy,

which may be indicative of a pathological circadian rhythm disruption in epilepsy as detected using

a commercial wearable device. The driving effect of this remains unclear; we were unable to detect

any relationship with seizures, so we instead propose that co-morbidities, ASMs, sleep disruption

or some other confounds may be involved, or that it is an additional effect - alongside seizures - of

the cellular dysfunction underlying the aetiology found in some epilepsies. We hope our findings

encourage further research of this phenomenon and whether it has application in seizure prediction

and chronotherapy in epilepsy, and further encourage use of intra-individual variability of circadian

properties as a wearable biomarker for disruption in other conditions.

S1 Methodological Details

S1.1 Comparison of circadian rhythm extraction methods

Approaches for computational modelling of the circadian rhythm broadly fall into two categories:

dynamic modelling, where the behaviour of the circadian system is represented within a set of

equations, and statistical modelling, where a periodic function approximating an underlying core

circadian fluctuation is fit to, or derived from, the data (Asgari-Targhi and Klerman, 2019). Here,

we apply the latter statistical modelling methods.

The simplest statistical modelling approach involves the fitting of a sinusoid wave. The rhythm

produced is fixed in period, acrophase and amplitude. However, it can often be empirically observed

(especially in uncontrolled conditions) that these properties vary over time from one circadian

cycle to the next (Asgari-Targhi and Klerman, 2019), potentially as the result of challenges to the

circadian system (e.g inconsistent night shift working), variation in lifestyle and behaviour (e.g

occasional late nights), or perhaps even disease (e.g the change between mood states in bipolar

disorder, or seizure occurrence in epilepsy).

Bandpass-filtering of the signal around 24 hours derives a circadian rhythm where amplitude

is able to vary across cycles, but the other parameters remain somewhat fixed. More sophisticated

methods exist, such as wavelet-based analysis (the continuous and discrete wavelet transform),

signal decomposition techniques (such as empirical mode decomposition) and others such as singu-

lar spectrum analysis (SSA) (Figure 2E(i)). An overview these methods can be found in (Eriksen

and Rehman, 2023). These methods are more flexible and produce a rhythm that fits the data

better, capturing variation in all three properties across cycles. Garćıa-Iglesias et al. (2023) eval-

uated these, as well as other, methods to extract a circadian rhythm from various physiological

parameters, including heart rate. They compared the goodness-of-fit of the rhythm extracted by

each method with the original data in each case. While certain methods performed better for some

measures, SSA was the best all-rounder across measures.

22



S1.2 Deriving circadian cycles for computing circadian properties

We split the rhythm into the individual circadian cycles (Figure 2E(ii)), and compute the daily

period, acrophase and amplitude (Figure 2G). To do so, the Hilbert transform is applied to the

extracted circadian rhythm, producing a complex-valued analytic signal, from which the circadian

“phase series” can be derived (Figure 2E(ii)). The phase series is a periodic triangular waveform

with bounds of −π to π. It is aligned with the input circadian rhythm, and can be thought of as

a measure of circadian progression; at −π the rhythm is at trough, and reaches its peak as phase

increases to 0. As phase increases further from 0 to π, the cycle falls again before it reaches the

next trough at π, where it wraps back around to −π. Using this, we can robustly split the rhythm

at each phase trough (−π) into the daily circadian cycles. Once we have collected individual cycles,

the circadian properties (Figure 1) are calculated for each cycle.

S1.3 Accounting for gaps in recording and variability in recording du-

ration between participants

As shown in Table 1, the recording duration for both PWE and controls in this cohort is uniquely

long, and there is substantial variation in recording duration between participants. These factors

necessitated two additional steps in the calculation of intra-individual variability: the splitting

of a participant’s recording into “runs” between missing gaps prior to extraction of the circadian

rhythm, and the grouping of extracted per-cycle circadian property values into “segments” prior

to computation of mean and standard deviation.

Missing data gaps in the recording were most likely caused by device charging or removal of the

device by the participant for whatever other reason. As the heart rate recordings were computed

by a proprietary Fitbit algorithm from raw PPG, it is possible that periods of noisy data (for

example, due to poor device contact with skin) were excluded also. SSA, and other modelling

methods, cannot handle missing data in the input recording, so interpolation (e.g linear) is re-

quired. However, there are occasionally very long (days-months) gaps of missing data for some

participants, so we opted to avoid running the algorithm over very long interpolations of data, as

23



this wasted computational resources and interfered with results. As such, the raw heart rate data

was split into ‘runs’ between missing gaps larger than 8 hours. Within each run, any remaining

gaps (which must be below 8 hours) were linearly interpolated.

As stated previously, the intra-individual variability approach involves computation of a mean

and standard deviation for each of the circadian properties (period, acrophase, amplitude) for each

participant. However, given the variation in recording duration between participants (and espe-

cially between PWE and controls) in this dataset, and given that estimation of mean and standard

deviation become more reliable as sample size increases, it would not be fair to compare the intra-

individual variability between a participant with, for example, a recording duration of a month

to a participant with multiple years worth of data. Therefore, once the circadian properties have

been calculated for each cycle, rather than calculating the mean and standard deviation of each

property across all cycles, we group cycles into consecutive non-overlapping seven-day ‘segments’.

Grouping occurred within runs; for example, a run that contained 17 circadian cycles would

produce 2 segments (14 cycles), with 3 cycles discarded. We opted to perform the segmenting

within runs rather than across the cycles of all runs as, given the minimum 8 hour gap between

runs, there may be a considerable gap of time between two consecutive runs.

For each seven-day segment, the standard deviation of each property (Figure 2G) was calcu-

lated, reflecting the variability of that property during the corresponding week. Therefore, for

each participant, a distribution of standard deviation values is produced for each property, reflect-

ing differences in variability across weeks. To summarise these distributions for each participant,

three summary values - circadian period variability, acrophase variability and amplitude variability

- were calculated by taking the mean of the standard deviation values of each property across the

segments distribution. Three additional summary values: period average, acrophase average and

amplitude average, were calculated in a similar manner, using the mean of each property across all

segments.

24



Calculating the mean and standard deviation separately for each segment ensures that they

are always calculated on samples of data of the same length (7 cycles), reducing the problem of

varying recording duration between participants. Taking the mean across all segments allows for

comaprison of circadian average and variability between participants.

A visualisation of our implementation of the intra-individual variability method, with the ad-

dition of the segmenting step, can be found in Figure 2.

(c) Table of random sub-sampling median p-values and z-statistics

Figure S3.1: Overview of the random sub-sampling correction to Figure 3. (a) and (b) show
the distribution of the z-statistic and p-value over 10,000 iterations of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test using
the entire Control cohort and a randomly selected sub-sample of 31 PWE. (a) shows this distribution
for Period Mean, which was not originally different between PWE and controls. This result holds after
applying random sub-sampling as the z-statistic is normally distributed around ∼0 (no effect) and the
p-value distribution is uniform. (b) shows this distribution for Period Std, which was originally different
between PWE and controls. This result also holds after applying random sub-sampling, as the z-statistic
is normally distributed around 2.5 (moderate effect) and the p-value distribution is extremely skewed
with a median < 0.05. (c) shows the median z-statistic and p-values across each property average and
variability.
