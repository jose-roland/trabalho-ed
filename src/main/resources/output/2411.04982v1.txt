We study a quantum system that consists of two fermionic chains coupled by a driven quantum
point contact (QPC). The QPC contains a bond with a periodically varying tunneling amplitude.
Initially the left chain is packed with fermions while the right one is empty. We numerically track
the evolution of the system and demonstrate that, at frequencies above a critical one, the current
through the QPC halts, and the particle imbalance between the chains remains forever. This implies
a spectacular breakdown of the Floquet version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis which
predicts a homogeneous particle density profile at large times. We confirm the effect for various
driving protocols and interparticle interactions.

Introduction. Leveraging a rich phenomenology of
quantum transport is essential for the advancement of
science and technology at nano- and microscales. The
unceasing theoretical efforts in understanding this phe-
nomenology are of crucial importance, as they provide
the foundation to interpret experimental results, predict
new phenomena, and guide the design of next-generation
quantum and microelectronic devices [1–5].

Here we contribute to these efforts by studying a sys-
tem of two tight-binding fermionic chains connected by a
quantum point contact (QPC) with a periodically driven
tunneling amplitude, see Fig. 1. Initially, the left chain
is filled by fermions while the right one is empty.

This system has been studied previously in the case of
noninteracting fermions [6]. It has been shown to exhibit
a nonequilibrium phase transition under the variation of
the driving frequency: while for low frequencies the QPC
is conducting, for frequencies above the single-particle
band gap the QPC turns to be insulating, and the initial
imbalance of particle densities lasts forever [6].

At first sight, the latter behavior should become im-
possible when the interactions between the fermions come
into play. This expectation is based on the Floquet ver-
sion of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (the Flo-
quet ETH) [7, 8] which is believed to hold for generic
interacting periodically-driven quantum many-body sys-
tems [7–13]. The Floquet ETH predicts that a state
locally indistinguishable from the infinite-temperature
thermal state will establish in the long run, which im-
plies the homogeneous distribution of particles across
both chains.

Here we demonstrate that this expectation is wrong:
the QPC remains insulating above a critical frequency
even when the interactions between the fermions are on.

This implies the breakdown of the Floquet ETH above
the critical frequency.

The rest of the Letter is organized as follows. In the
next section we introduce our model, observables and
methods. Then we report and interpret the results. Fi-
nally, we discuss the results and give an outlook of pos-
sible further developments.

Model. The system under study consists of two
one-dimensional chains harboring spinless fermions, see
Fig. 1. The lengths of the chains are (L + 1) and L.
They are chosen to be unequal to avoid degeneracies due
to the reflection symmetry. The chains are connected by
a driven QPC. The total Hamiltonian reads

Ht = HL +HR + Vint + Vt, (1)

Here HL and HR describe hopping along left and right
chains, respectively,

terparticle interaction term and Vt is the time-periodic
Hamiltonian of the QPC acting exclusively on the pair
of boundary sites, see Fig 1. Here we focus on the specific

where ω is the driving frequency, nj = c†jcj is the particle

Supplementary Material [14]. The noninteracting case of
U = 0 was studied in ref. [6].
The number of fermions is conserved and we fix it to

be N = L + 1. Initially, the fermions fill the left chain,

Its expectation value ⟨NR⟩t = ⟨Ψt|NR|Ψt⟩ is initially zero

where Φα are the Floquet eigenstates, i.e. eigenstates
of the operator of quantum evolution over the driving
period τ = 2π/ω.

cies. For a frequency below the critical one (left column) par-
ticles tend to distribute uniformly over sites. For a frequency
above the critical one (right column) the particle imbalance

eates two chains.

Results. We use the QuSpin package [15, 16] to nu-
merically solve the Schrödinger equation and compute
Floquet spectrum and eigenstates for finite systems of
sizes up to 2L + 1 = 15. We do this for various fre-
quencies. We find qualitative differences in the dynamics
and Floquet eigenstates above and below some critical
frequency ωc, see Fig. 3. For not too large interaction
strengths U ≲ 1, this critical frequency approximately
equals 2, as in the noninteracting case [6].
For frequencies below the critical one the system

evolves towards thermalization: particles flow from the
left chain to the right one through the QPC and eventu-
ally distribute uniformly across both chains, see Fig. 2
and Fig. 3 (a). The equilibrium value ⟨NR⟩∞ coincides,
up to small finite size corrections, with the value

NR = N L/(2L+ 1) (9)

obtained for the uniform distribution of particles over the

The horizontal black line shows the value of NR corresponding to the uniform distribution of particles over the chains. The
interaction strength is U = 0.5. The total number of sites and fermions is 2L+ 1 = 15 and N = 8, respectively. (b) Diagonal

difference in the scaling behavior for frequencies below and above the critical frequency ωc ≃ 2.

sites of the system.

In contrast, for frequencies above the critical one the
QPC effectively turns insulating: the particles stay in the
left chain and never come to the right one. In this case
the equilibrium value ⟨NR⟩∞ is around zero, as shown in
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 (a).

The diagonal matrix elements ⟨Φα|NR|Φα⟩ of NR over
the Floquet basis is shown in Fig. 3 (b). The patterns
below and above the critical frequency are distinctly dif-
ferent. Below the critical frequency the matrix elements
tightly concentrate around NR, consistent with the Flo-

quet ETH.

In contrast, above the critical frequency matrix el-
ements are scattered over a wide interval, with mini-
mum and maximal instances almost reaching minimal
and maximal eigenvalues of NR, which are 0 and L, re-
spectively.

To check whether our results can be relevant in the
thermodynamic limit, we perform a finite size scaling, see
Fig. 4. In Fig. 4 (a) the scaling of the equilibrium value
⟨NR⟩∞ is shown. One can see that for frequencies below
the critical one it scales linearly with the system size, as

expected under the assumption of uniform particle distri-
bution in equilibrium. In contrast, for frequencies above
the critical one no growth is observed.

In Fig. 4 (b) the Floquet ETH is tested directly. There
we plot the maximal deviation ∆max of the diagonal ma-
trix element ⟨Φα|NR|Φα⟩ from the uniform value NR

(maximization is performed over all Floquet eigenstates),
normalized to the system size:

∆max = (2L+ 1)−1 max
α

∣∣∣⟨Φα|NR|Φα⟩ −NR

∣∣∣. (10)

If the Floquet ETH is valid, ∆max should decrease with
the system size. This is indeed the case for frequencies
below the critical one, as can be seen from 4 (b). In
contrast, above the critical frequency this figure of merit
stays approximately constant, indicting the breakdown
of the Floquet ETH.

We have verified that the above qualitative picture is
robust with respect to variations of the interaction term
Vint, as well as the periodic function ft that modulates
the hopping amplitude in the QPC in eq. (4), provided
it averages to zero over the period,

∫ τ

ft dt = 0. The

results for a number of exemplary models are presented
in the Supplement [14].

Discussion and outlook. To summarize, we have
demonstrated a nonequilibrium phase transition between
thermal and athermal phases in a periodically driven in-
teracting disorder-free quantum many-body system. The
system consists of two fermionic chains connected by a
driven QPC. The transition occurs upon the variation of
the driving frequency. For frequencies below the critical
one the QPC is conducting, and the fermions eventually
spread homogeneously across the chains, in accordance
with the Floquet ETH. For frequencies exceeding the
critical frequency, the QPC is insulating, and the initial
particle imbalance between the chains remains forever,
in stark contrast to the prediction based on the Floquet
ETH.

The above frequency dependence of the effect sharply
distinguishes it from other known types of the Floquet
thermalization breakdown. In particular, in non-generic
Floquet systems featuring integrability, exact quantum
many-body scars or Hilbert space fragmentation, the vi-
olation of the Floquet ETH and the thermalization break-
down typically take place for arbitrary driving frequen-
cies, and athermal eigenstates often are independent on
the frequency [17–23]. Alternatively, the breakdown or
slowdown of thermalization can occur for a discrete set of
frequencies in such systems [24–31]. A completely differ-
ent frequency dependence of the Floquet ETH violation
reported here may indicate a distinct origin of this vio-
lation – a question left for further studies.

It should be emphasized that the thermalization break-
down reported here can not be explained by the Flo-
quet prethermalization [32–36]. The latter phenomenon

implies the thermalization slowdown at large frequen-
cies, with the thermalization time depending exponen-
tially on the frequency. If the system under study ex-
hibited “mere” prethermalization, the particle imbalance
between the chains would be eventually washed out. We
know that this is not the case, since in finite systems
under study we have access to arbitrary long times, as
well as to the infinite-time averages (8). Furthermore,
the critical frequency is not, in fact, large enough for
the prethermalization mechanism to be effective, as we
demonstrate in the Supplement [14].

An intriguing question for further studies concerns the
scope of the reported effect. While we have demonstrated
its robustness in one-dimensional geometry, our numer-
ical tests do not extend to higher dimensions. It is not
uncommon when exotic out-of-equilibrium phenomena in
one dimension have no counterparts in higher dimen-
sions [37–42]. It is therefore reasonable to ask whether
the reported type of the Floquet thermalization break-
down extends beyond one-dimensional geometry. We
note that this question, while challenging for numerical
exploration, can perhaps be addressed with the state-of-
the-art quantum simulators with planar arrangement of
qubits [43–47].

As a word of caution, we note that, in the case of non-
interacting fermions, dissipation (caused e.g. by phonon-
fermion interactions) destroys the phase transition and
makes the QPC conducting at any frequency [48]. Likely
it will have the same effect in the interacting case. This
should be accounted for while conceiving experimental
tests of the effect.

“Fermionic transport through a driven quantum point contact:
breakdown of Floquet thermalization beyond a critical driving frequency”

by Ivan V. Dudinets and Oleg Lychkovskiy.

S1. Various driving protocols

Here we present results for various driving protocols ft in eq. (4). The protocols under study are shown in Fig. S1.
The results are shown in Figs. S2— S5. One can see that they are qualitatively similar to the results reported in the
main text.

S2. A QPC with on-site potential

It was found in ref. [6] that, in the noninteracting case, an alternating on-site potential within the QPC typically
destroys the effect and ensures the current flow at any frequency. However, a notable exception was found for the
QPC term Vt given by

Vt = −1

with the tunneling amplitude ft = sin(ωt) and on-site potential gt = sin(ωt). We have found the same qualitative
picture in the interacting case. In particular, the current halts completely for the above Vt, as shown in Fig. S6.

S3. Various interaction terms

We have verified that the physical picture remains the same for various types of interaction terms. As an illustration,
we show in Fig. S7 the results for

S4. Estimate of the prethermalization time and energy scales

A conservative estimate Λ of the prethermalization energy scale is obtained as the sum of operator norms of
Hamiltonian terms with a support covering a fixed site [36]. For our system (1)-(5) this implies Λ = 1 + 2U .
The ratio of frequency-dependent thermalization timescales τth(ω) for two different frequencies is estimated as

τth(ω2)/τth(ω1) ∼ exp ((ω2 − ω1)/Λ). For ω1 = 1.5, ω2 = 2.5 and U = 0.5 this estimate reads τth(ω2)/τth(ω1) ∼√
e ≃ 1.6. Thus the prethermalization timescales for these two frequencies should be of the same order of magnitude.

However, we clearly observe thermalization at the frequency ω1, with τth(ω1) ∼ 10, while no thermalization is observed
at the frequency ω2 up to times ∼ 1000 τth(ω1). This argument confirms that the observed lack of thermalization can
not be explained by “mere” prethermalization.
