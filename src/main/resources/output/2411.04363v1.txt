Abstract
Predicting how genetic variation affects phenotypic outcomes at the organismal, cellular, and
molecular levels requires deciphering the cis-regulatory code, the sequence rules by which
non-coding regions regulate genes. In this perspective, we discuss recent computational
progress and challenges towards solving this fundamental problem. We describe how
cis-regulatory elements are mapped and how their sequence rules can be learned and
interpreted with sequence-to-function neural networks, with the goal of identifying genetic
variants in human disease. We also discuss how studies of the 3D chromatin organization could
help identifying long-range regulatory effects and how current methods for mapping gene
regulatory networks could better describe biological processes. We point out current gaps in
knowledge along with technical limitations and benchmarking challenges of computational
methods. Finally, we discuss newly emerging technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, and
outline strategies for creating a more general model of the cis-regulatory code that is more
broadly applicable across cell types and individuals.

Keywords: Computational genomics, transcriptional regulation, cis-regulatory code,
sequence-to-function models, gene regulatory networks

Glossary

● Cis-regulatory element (CRE): A DNA region in the genome bound by transcription
factors or other proteins and contributes to gene regulation. It regulates a target gene in
cis, thus its proximity to the gene on DNA is important. The most commonly studied
CREs are enhancers, promoters, and architectural elements.

● Cis-regulatory code: The set of rules by which CREs are read by transcription factors
and control gene expression.

● Enhancer: A CRE harboring motifs for one or more transcription factors with the ability
to become active in one or more cellular conditions, resulting typically in the
enhancement of transcription of a nearby gene. When not active, enhancers may be
bound by repressive transcription factors.

● Transcription factor motif: Short DNA sequence pattern recognized by a transcription
factor through protein-DNA interactions.

● Position Weight Matrix (PWM): a mathematical model for representing a transcription
factor binding motif, where the frequencies of each base are summarized for each
position.

● Chromatin state: The state in which genomic regions are found in vivo in the context of
nucleosomes. Of specific interest are the chromatin states that change dynamically
depending on the cellular conditions, such as DNA accessibility, histone modifications,
and other bound proteins, since they are often the cause or effect of ongoing regulatory
processes of transcriptional regulation.



● ChIP-seq: Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. An assay for genome-wide
profiling of transcription factor binding, histone modifications, and other features of
chromatin state that can be specifically targeted by an antibody.

● ATAC-seq: Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, an
experimental method for the genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility.
scATAC-seq refers to the single-cell version.

● scRNA-seq: Genome-wide assay that measures RNA abundance in single cells.
● Multi-omics assay: Assays that measure multiple data modalities simultaneously,

ideally as a single-cell assay. The most common example is the combination of RNA-seq
and ATAC-seq.

● Hi-C: A high throughput technique for mapping the 3D structure of chromatin by
mapping the pairwise contact frequencies between genomic regions.

● Contact map: A description of the 3D chromatin structure as mapped by Hi-C or related
techniques, which is useful for understanding regulatory interactions among CREs and
genes.

● CTCF: CCCTC-binding factor, a protein with a major role in regulating the 3D chromatin
structure.

● Loop extrusion: A model that proposes that long-range cis-interactions within a DNA
molecule are generated by loop extrusion factors (e.g., cohesin) that bind to DNA and
reel flanking regions of the same DNA molecule into a loop that is demarcated by
insulating elements (e.g., CTCF binding in convergent orientation).

● Neural network: A type of machine learning model, which can be trained to make
accurate predictions from large amounts of complex data, typically by allowing many
flexible parameters without specifying specific variables, features, or their relationships
(black box model).

● Deep learning model: A neural network model with many layers (is “deep”), typically
used to learn complex features of the cis-regulatory code.

● Sequence-to-function model: A neural network trained to predict experimental data
(“function”) from DNA sequences. The model architecture and sequence input length can
vary depending on whether transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, histone
modification data, gene expression or genome contact maps are predicted. Examples
are convolutional neural networks and transformers.

● Interpreting a neural network/deep learning model: Using specific interpretation tools
to open a black-box model to understand what features and rules a neural network
model learned during training.

● Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): Genomic sequences in which specific
bases (A, C, T, or G) differ between individuals.

● Genome-wide association studies (GWAS): Statistical analysis of how genetic
variants (usually SNPs) in individuals are associated with traits or diseases.

● Gene regulatory network (GRN): A collection of direct regulatory relationships between
transcription factors, CREs, and target genes, often used as a model for expression
changes between cellular conditions.



● cis-GRN: GRNs reconstructed based on analyzing cis-regulatory elements and TF
motifs.

● trans-GRN: GRNs reconstructed based on analyzing co-expression between TFs and
target genes.

The fundamental problem of the cis-regulatory code
Predicting how genetic variation affects phenotypic outcomes at the organismal, cellular, and molecular
levels is a key challenge in biology. This is especially difficult for variants found in the non-coding portion
of the genome, which regulates when, where, and at which level genes are transcribed in each cell type.
Gene regulatory instructions are encoded in units of 100bp- to 1kb-long DNA sequences called
cis-regulatory elements (CREs). CREs such as enhancers and promoters contain binding sites for
transcription factors (TFs), which function together with various transcriptional regulators and complexes
to set the desired gene expression levels. This cis-regulatory code, the set of rules by which CRE
sequences collectively control gene expression in a cell type, is incompletely understood, which makes it
extremely challenging to predict how genetic variation alters gene regulation.

A comprehensive understanding of the cis-regulatory code would provide a blueprint of how cells
differentiate into the various cell types during embryonic development, predict how genetic variants
influence development and health, and identify the molecular mechanisms altered by disease-associated
genetic differences. The resulting knowledge may also allow us to develop therapeutic interventions,
including engineering enhancer variants with highly specific activities, to direct cells toward favorable
gene expression programs that restore and maintain cellular function.

Deciphering the cis-regulatory code is an extraordinarily complex problem. Each cell type has a unique
combination of TFs, expressed at specific levels and whose activity is sometimes controlled by
extracellular signals. Given the activity levels of all TFs in a given cell type, the transcription of all genes
should be predictable from the DNA sequence alone. However, such predictions are challenging since
TFs can act combinatorially and influence multiple regulatory layers: TFs cooperate to bind and access
CREs, change the chromatin environment around CREs, recruit other regulatory proteins, and, together
with TFs at other CREs, regulate the transcription of target genes. Furthermore, many CREs can be read
by specific TF combinations that may only be present in specific cell types. Thus, complexity arises from
the many regulatory layers and the cell-type-specific nature by which TFs regulate these layers.

Although deciphering the cis-regulatory complexity is a daunting challenge, there has been tremendous
progress (Figure 1). We have a much-improved understanding of gene regulation (Preissl et al., 2023;
Zeitlinger, 2020; Bonn and Furlong, 2008; Yáñez-Cuna et al., 2013; Kim and Wysocka, 2023) and a vast
and growing number of genomics data sets from multiple experimental assays over many cell types and
conditions. Importantly, advances in computational methods, especially deep learning (Eraslan et al.,
2019), have shown that complex cis-regulatory rules can be learned from such data sets in a given cell
type. These approaches increasingly reveal mechanistic insights into TF cooperativity, make experimental
predictions, and allow the effect of genetic variants to be studied.

In this perspective, we delve into the current computational challenges facing the field of regulatory
genomics, with a specific focus on the cis-regulatory code that regulates transcription (for
post-transcriptional mechanisms, see (Keene, 2007; Zhao et al., 2017)). We discuss state-of-the-art

computational methods that aim to map CREs, learn the cis-regulatory rules of specific cell types, predict
the effect of genetic variants, incorporate 3D chromatin organization to characterize long-range regulatory
effects, and map gene regulatory networks during specific biological processes (Figure 1). We provide our
perspective on the current gaps in knowledge, limitations of current methods and how to benchmark
them, and opportunities for developing methods that analyze and integrate newly emerging data, such as
those from spatial omics technologies. Finally, we outline possible strategies for closing the remaining
gaps and creating a path toward a more general model of the cis-regulatory code that is more broadly
applicable across cell types and individuals.

Leveraging experimental progress: chromatin-based
annotations of CREs
The advent of high-throughput genomic technologies has made it possible to comprehensively map the
regulatory landscape across the genome in many cell types and conditions (Hawkins et al., 2010; Zhou et
al., 2011). The basic building blocks of the cis-regulatory code, the TFs that bind to sequence motifs, can
be mapped genome-wide inside cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to sequencing
(ChIP-seq) or related assays. However, TF binding in vivo is highly cooperative and cell-type specific, and
extensive ChIP experiments are only available for a few human cell types (Moore et al., 2020). Therefore,
although the binding specificity of the majority of human TFs has been experimentally determined
(Lambert et al., 2018; Rauluseviciute et al., 2024), our understanding of the combinatorial landscape by
which TFs cooperate to access and regulate different CREs across cell types is still limited.

To facilitate the discovery of CREs and their TF binding sites, a popular approach is to identify the
genomic sequences that are accessible in chromatin. CREs have long been known to be hypersensitive
to DNase digestion (Burch and Weintraub, 1983), and DNase-seq provides comprehensive and
quantitative information on chromatin accessibility genome-wide (Song and Crawford, 2010; Thurman et
al., 2012). Another convenient assay to measure chromatin accessibility with less input material is
ATAC-seq (Buenrostro et al., 2015). However, while such assays allow the comprehensive identification
of accessible regions in a cell type, which of these candidate CREs contribute to gene regulation under
the examined conditions, and what class of CREs they might represent is unclear.

The classes of CREs can be broadly divided into those that tend to be constitutively open and those that
are accessible in a cell-type-specific manner (Ernst and Kellis, 2013). Promoters, the regions around the
transcription start sites that initiate transcription, as well as architectural elements that help organize
chromatin in 3D (e.g., CTCF-bound regions), are two broad classes of CREs that tend to be constitutively
open (Phillips and Corces, 2009). The cell-type-specific activation of promoters occurs through a class of
CREs called enhancers, which can be located near the promoter or can contact the promoter from distal
locations, e.g., up to multiple megabases away. Enhancers are open in a cell-type-specific fashion and
thus can be identified through their differential accessibility. However, not all accessible CREs are active,
and they may even have a repressive effect on the surrounding chromatin when harboring motifs for
repressive TFs (Segert et al., 2021; Pang and Snyder, 2020; Berest et al., 2019). Other CREs may have a
constitutive repressive effect, e.g., by more broadly promoting repressive chromatin marked by
H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 (Thurman et al., 2012; Delest et al., 2012).

To better classify the function of candidate CREs, additional data sets that measure aspects of the
chromatin state are helpful, including histone modifications measured by ChIP-seq. Specifically, active

enhancers tend to be flanked by high histone acetylation levels and specific forms of histone methylation
(e.g., H3K27ac, H3K4me1). Other markers for active enhancers are the presence of transcriptional
co-activators (e.g., p300, Brd4, and Mediator) and enhancer transcription (e.g., measured by CAGE,
PRO-seq, or NET-seq) (Policastro and Zentner, 2021). Obtaining comprehensive experimental data for
characterizing chromatin states has been a major goal for the ENCODE (Moore et al., 2020) and
Roadmap Epigenomics (Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015) projects and has opened the
door to systematically analyzing CREs across cell types.

As data for multiple chromatin marks are often collected in the same cell type, a common strategy for
systematically annotating candidate CREs is to integrate information using multivariate hidden Markov
models such as ChromHMM, or related probabilistic models, to define chromatin states (Ernst and Kellis,
2010, 2012; Hoffman et al., 2012; Libbrecht et al., 2021). This strategy has been used for CRE
annotations across a wide range of cell types and conditions (Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al.,
2015). In addition to directly using observed data, CREs have been annotated in cell types with
incompletely observed data using imputed epigenomic datasets (Ernst and Kellis, 2015; Schreiber et al.,
2020). The availability of data from hundreds of cell types and conditions has also spurred analysis
approaches that can directly categorize different classes of cell-type restricted or constitutively active
CREs (Meuleman et al., 2020; Vu and Ernst, 2022).

While such chromatin-based approaches have increased the number of identified putative CREs into the
millions (Meuleman et al., 2020; Moore et al., 2020), many additional CREs are likely encoded in the
genome. For example, evolutionarily conserved sequence analyses suggest that a substantial portion of
conserved non-coding bases are not well captured by large compendiums of annotations (Christmas et
al., 2023; Grujic et al., 2020). Therefore, expanding these data sets by profiling rare or hard-to-access cell
types and conditions is critical.

Single-cell chromatin assays are ideal for capturing CREs from rare cell types. Due to their sparsity and
dimensionality, these datasets add additional computational challenges. The most widely applied
single-cell chromatin assay is ATAC-seq, sometimes jointly performed with gene expression (Preissl et al.,
2023). Single-cell assays for measuring other epigenetic features, including histone modifications and
DNA methylation, have also been developed and continue to mature, along with computational methods
to integrate the resulting data (Preissl et al., 2023; Shema et al., 2019). To inform mechanistic models of
gene regulation, another useful chromatin assay is single-molecule footprinting. This technology uses
exogenous DNA methylation to capture the footprints of bound TFs and nucleosomes on the same DNA
molecule, allowing absolute measurements of bound fractions and co-occurrence events in a population
of cells (Kreibich et al., 2023; Sönmezer et al., 2021). In the future, assays that measure how chromatin
accessibility, TF binding, and histone marks are spatially organized inside cells (Deng et al., 2022; Lu et
al., 2022) could provide additional cell-type-specific information on gene regulation.

A continuing challenge is to benchmark CRE annotations. Traditionally, this is performed by comparing
the results with established genome annotations and other experimental data not used during model
learning (Ernst and Kellis, 2010; Vu and Ernst, 2022). However, this approach does not directly validate
novel annotations. Additional high-throughput functional assays, such as massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRA) and non-coding CRISPR-based screens, provide a promising avenue to evaluate and
characterize CRE annotations (Gasperini et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2024).

The solution to complexity: sequence-to-function models
The ultimate goal of understanding CRE function is to decipher the cis-regulatory code embedded within
these sequences. Each assay measures specific regulatory activities across the genome in a given cell
type, and these activities should be driven by TF binding motifs and possibly other sequence patterns
within CRE sequences. However, determining the exact relationship between sequence and a given
functional readout is difficult. The traditional approach is to select the regions with high TF binding,
chromatin accessibility, or enhancer activity and to identify TF motifs that are statistically overrepresented
(McLeay and Bailey, 2010). While this provides a set of TF motifs, it does not capture how the affinity and
syntax of the motifs in their genomic context affect the readout (Crocker et al., 2008; Farley et al., 2016).
Since each genomic region is very different, discovering genome-wide rules by which motifs interact and
predicting the experimental readout is challenging. Fortunately, it is now possible to train neural networks
(“sequence-to-function models”) to perform this task.

During training, sequence-to-function models learn to predict an experimental readout across a large
number of CREs directly from the underlying genomic sequence. By optimizing the prediction accuracy,
the model learns sequence rules inside a ‘black box’ without prior biological assumptions. When the
predictive performance is high on withheld data not seen by the model during training, this suggests that
the learned rules apply genome-wide. To train on different experimental data types, models are typically
optimized to the biological problem of interest. They may differ in their DNA input size, the selection of
regions, model type (e.g., convolutional neural networks or transformers), architecture and model size
(e.g., filters, layers, receptive field), and loss function. In general, training a model to predict
high-resolution, high-coverage data quantitatively at base resolution produces the most nuanced
sequence features (Avsec, Weilert, et al., 2021; Toneyan et al., 2022). For some purposes, models
predict binary or categorical data or data that are averaged across genomic bins, which reduces the
computing requirements. For example, by binning to 128 bp and using a transformer architecture,
Enformer predicts data across 200 kb (Avsec, Agarwal, et al., 2021; K. M. Chen et al., 2022; Kelley, 2020;
Kelley et al., 2018).

The high prediction accuracy of these models is useful on their own, e.g., to test the effect of genetic
variants, but considerable power of sequence-to-function models lies in their interpretation. This is
counterintuitive as ‘black box’ models are traditionally considered as uninterpretable because features
and relationships are learned in a distributed manner inside the neural network. However, with DNA
sequence being a relatively simple input, interpretation approaches that query the model as a whole have
been very successful in revealing sequence motifs and their syntax rules (Novakovsky et al., 2023;
Alipanahi et al., 2015; de Almeida et al., 2022; Avsec, Weilert, et al., 2021). This suggests that DNA ‘black
box’ models are interpretable, at least to the extent that the rules follow somewhat expected patterns. An
alternative is to incorporate a priori biological knowledge into the neural network architecture, but these
constraints come at the expense of learning more complex phenomena and cannot capture unknown
cis-regulatory sequence rules (e.g.,(Agarwal et al., 2021; Novakovsky et al., 2023; Balcı et al., 2023).
Therefore, interpreting ‘black box’ models is currently the best approach to uncover new sequence rules
in the cell type of interest.

There are several complementary approaches by which models can be interpreted. The most common
first step is to use an attribution method (e.g., DeepLIFT (Shrikumar et al., 2019) or Deep SHAP
(Lundberg and Lee, 2017)), which assigns scores for how much each feature in the input (i.e., each base)
contributes to the output prediction. Motifs highlighted in genomic regions by high scores can be

summarized by tools like TF-MoDisco (Shrikumar et al., 2020). These TF motif representations can then
label high-scoring motif instances in the genome. This approach outperforms traditional position weight
matrix (PWM) methods (Avsec, Weilert, et al., 2021) because motif instances mapped in this way were
informative to the model in the specific genomic sequence context.

To extract additional sequence rules, such as how TF motifs interact, trained models can be queried with
in silico sequence designs, e.g., by perturbing motifs in genomic sequences or injecting motifs into
randomized sequences (Zhou and Troyanskaya, 2015; Alipanahi et al., 2015; Avsec, Weilert, et al., 2021;
Trevino et al., 2021; Nair et al., 2022; de Almeida et al., 2022; Koo et al., 2021). Analyzing predictions
with systematic sequence designs allows the extraction of relative motif affinities (Alexandari et al., 2023;
Brennan et al., 2023) and specific syntax rules by which motif pairs interact (Avsec, Weilert, et al., 2021;
de Almeida et al., 2022; Koo et al., 2021).

In this manner, the genome-wide cis-regulatory sequence rules that underlie various data modalities have
been characterized and linked to molecular mechanisms (Novakovsky et al., 2023). For example, the
syntax rules by which TFs cooperate based on in vivo binding data show that some TFs preferentially
interact when the motifs are within nucleosome distance, while others may physically cooperate on DNA
when the motifs are spaced at a fixed distance (Avsec, Weilert, et al., 2021). These rules match prior
mechanistic studies (Smith et al., 2023; Long et al., 2016), showing that neural networks can learn
accurate biological representations without a priori knowledge of the underlying biophysical properties
and mechanistic principles.

Sequence-to-function models can also predict or interpret how TF binding relates to cell-type-specific
chromatin environments. Some approaches incorporate chromatin features alongside sequence as model
inputs, allowing the models to distinguish between direct sequence predictors of TF-DNA binding and a
more generalized dependency on chromatin state (Srivastava et al., 2021; Arora et al., 2023). With a
sufficiently complex sequence-to-function model, chromatin accessibility and other chromatin features can
themselves be predicted from DNA, revealing the sequence rules by which TFs shape the chromatin
landscape. Such approaches have revealed that TFs drive chromatin accessibility proportional to the
motif affinity, that some TFs have a repressive effect, and that TFs often function synergistically in making
chromatin accessible (D. S. Kim et al., 2021; Brennan et al., 2023; Bravo González-Blas et al., 2024).
Presumably, these sequence rules reflect how TFs act on nucleosomes (Brennan et al., 2023), but the
mechanisms for this type of TF cooperativity are not well understood. Here is therefore an opportunity for
sequence models to inspire mechanistic studies.

Another challenge is understanding how sequence rules specify enhancer activity and target gene
activation. The rules of enhancer activity differ from those of chromatin accessibility (Brennan et al.,
2023), but how exactly is not well understood. Models trained on large-scale reporter assays have shown
that motif syntax and repressive motifs are important for enhancer activity (de Almeida et al., 2022; Movva
et al., 2019). These assays are however typically episomal and use short DNA regions (Inoue et al.,
2017), thus it would be beneficial to obtain additional insights into enhancer activity. For example,
ChIP-seq signals of histone modifications typically flank active enhancers in the genome and can be
predicted from DNA sequence (Avsec, Agarwal, et al., 2021; K. M. Chen et al., 2022; Kelley, 2020; Kelley
et al., 2018), but no careful model interpretation has been performed to understand the underlying
cis-regulatory sequence rules.

Ultimately, one would like to directly predict gene expression, either steady-state RNA levels or nascent
transcription data, from DNA sequence. This is possible and yields highly accurate predictions (Avsec,
Agarwal, et al., 2021; Kelley et al., 2018; Linder et al., 2023) and promoter syntax (Dudnyk et al., 2024;
He and Danko, 2024; Cochran et al., 2024). However, the input from distal enhancers is not well
captured, suggesting that the models are missing some cell-type-specific sequence rules, perhaps related
to enhancer activation or long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions (Karollus et al., 2023; Kathail et
al., 2024).

This shows that our understanding of the cis-regulatory code and the molecular mechanisms by which
TFs mediate enhancer activation and target gene expression is still incomplete. Current models
specifically learn the data on which they were trained and are thus specific for a data modality and cell
type. There is no straightforward way to combine sequence rules from different models coherently. One
solution may be to train many data modalities as a multi-task model (Avsec, Agarwal, et al., 2021; K. M.
Chen et al., 2022; Kelley, 2020; Kelley et al., 2018), but this does not necessarily mean that the learned
sequence rules are more coherent and better represent biology.

A solution for handling different data modalities is to learn assay biases in separate deep learning models
(e.g., Tn5 insertion bias in ATAC-seq data) such that specific features of the cis-regulatory code can be
learned more explicitly (Brennan et al., 2023; Pampari et al., 2023). If the biophysical properties of these
rules are known, secondary surrogate models can be trained to fit these properties, e.g. TF binding and
cooperativity (Seitz et al., 2024). This could eventually lead to biophysical models of the cis-regulatory
code, but this would require extensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms beyond transcription
factor binding, which currently does not exist.

To improve existing models or develop new models, a better mechanistic understanding of the
cis-regulatory code through systematic interpretation of various models would be highly beneficial. While
interpreting models to uncover new biology, it may also be important to examine the model’s limitations,
e.g., using data simulation models (Chen and Capra, 2020; V. Chen et al., 2022; Prakash et al., 2021),
and to analyze the limitations of the experimental data, e.g., assay biases, experimental artifacts, or the
effect of low resolution or low coverage. If this is done for many data sets and modalities, the sequence
rules should overlap and provide clearer expectations of the underlying biophysical constraints and
molecular mechanisms that lead to the activation of enhancers and their target genes. The ultimate
challenge will be to train models that generalize cis-regulatory rules and can predict data for cell types not
trained on, a goal that may require significant computational innovation involving domain adaptation.

Meanwhile, experimental validation is needed to ensure the learned sequence rules are accurate. One
approach is to predict and test the effect of targeted perturbations, e.g., mutating genomic regions by
CRISPR (Avsec, Weilert, et al., 2021) or knocking down a TF (Brennan et al., 2023). Large-scale MPRA
reporter assays can be used to validate the learned sequence rules at higher throughput (D. S. Kim et al.,
2021). A powerful validation is to use the trained model to create synthetic enhancers and test them in
vivo with a reporter assay. Synthetic designs can be generated from random sequences, manual
manipulation or trimming of existing enhancers, or through de novo design of enhancers (de Almeida et
al., 2024; Taskiran et al., 2024). In the future, such synthetic enhancer designs could be used to create
enhancers with increased or altered function, with the potential of using such designs for therapeutic
treatments.

From genotype to phenotype: predicting the effect of
regulatory variants
A promising application of sequence-to-function models is the prediction and interpretation of regulatory
variants involved in the predisposition, onset or progression of complex diseases. Most SNPs identified in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) fall in the non-coding portion of the human genome (Buniello
et al., 2019). However, due to linkage disequilibrium, the SNPs identified in GWAS are often not the
causal variants but are located nearby. This necessitates fine-mapping to pinpoint the causal variants,
most of which are expected to alter gene expression. Sequence-to-function models can be used to
identify and interpret regulatory variants by quantifying their predicted effect on expression variation or
other molecular features.

Different types of gene expression variation are however not equally amenable to modeling. Predicting
gene-to-gene variation within the same cell type is an easier task because the levels vary widely and can
be predicted from promoter-proximal sequences without a comprehensive understanding of the
cis-regulatory code of distal enhancers (Karollus et al., 2023). Predicting the variation between cell types
across an organism is more challenging because the cis-regulatory code is highly diverse across cell
types and often driven by distal enhancers far away from promoters. Predicting variation in gene
expression across individuals in a population is the most challenging task (Sasse et al., 2023; Huang et
al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023). Not only does it require predicting cell-type-specific gene expression of
individual genetic variants, whose effects are often small, but also how they affect specific gene
expression programs and phenotypes of cells, leading to disease susceptibility (Manolio et al., 2009).
Only very few examples exist where this is well characterized (e.g., (Claussnitzer et al., 2015)).

A starting point for this challenging task is to assess which genetic variants differentially affect TF binding.
The simplest models use PWMs to assess how TF motif affinities differ between the alternate and the
reference alleles (Kumar et al., 2017; Fornes et al., 2018; Santana-Garcia et al., 2019). Predictions from
such methods can correlate well with observed allele-specific binding events derived from ChIP-seq
experiments (Fornes et al., 2018). More sophisticated models of TF binding specificity are trained on
high-throughput data, such as in vitro TF binding data (Martin et al., 2019). Another category of methods
combines multiple features, such as evolutionary conservation, chromatin states, and enhancer-promoter
interactions, to predict causal variants. Such models are trained or evaluated on known genetic variants
from the Human Gene Mutation Database or ClinVar (Gao et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2017; Rogers et al.,
2018) and can be combined into ensemble models (Zhang et al., 2019).

If sequence-to-function models are trained on molecular genomic data sets, they can directly predict how
genetic variants alter the experimental outcome (Sokolova et al., 2024). This is because these models
learn genome-wide rules and make accurate predictions across diverse genomic sequences, including
variants not directly trained on. Models that predict TF binding, chromatin accessibility, and histone
modifications are very accurate in this regard (Zhou and Troyanskaya, 2015; Kelley et al., 2016; Trevino
et al., 2021; Z. Chen et al., 2023). However, it is not always clear how these activities drive enhancer
activation and specific changes in nearby promoter activity. Therefore, sequence-to-function models that
predict MPRA reporter activity (Movva et al., 2019) and expression data are appealing (Zhou et al., 2018;
Avsec, Agarwal, et al., 2021; Linder et al., 2023). While these models perform well on promoter and
splicing variants, their performance is limited when predicting cell-type-specific effects involving
long-range enhancer-promoter interactions (Karollus et al., 2023). Thus, current models still show gaps in

predicting the effect of genetic variants on gene expression. However, due to their ability to predict which
mutations have an effect, they are increasingly used to identify and interpret regulatory variants.

For studying complex human disease, the additional information gained from sequence-to-function
models have so far been limited based on multiple evaluations in the context of GWAS data (Dey et al.,
2020). This may change with more advanced sequence-to-function models, the availability of more data,
and better strategies for integrating the model predictions with human GWAS data. A major obstacle is
that the model predictions are specific for the cell type of the training data, and thus in many cases do not
cover the cell types relevant for the GWAS traits. A potential bridge between genetic variants and disease
traits is gene expression data or other genomics data profiled across individuals, ideally from a tissue of
interest for the trait (Drusinsky et al., 2024). These data can be used to infer molecular quantitative trait
loci (QTLs) (e.g.,(Ramdas et al., 2022)). While there has been limited overlap between expression QTLs
and GWAS hits (Mostafavi et al., 2023), additional molecular QTLs have shown greater though still partial
overlap (Wu et al., 2023). Overall, identifying and interpreting causal genetic variants from GWAS studies
is still a major challenge.

A potentially lower-hanging fruit is to use sequence-to-function models to identify genetic variants that
cause rare diseases (Sokolova et al., 2024). Rare variants are likely purged from the population by
purifying selection and thus can have larger effect sizes that are more easily detected. Since they are rare
in the population, GWAS studies lack the power to discover them, but they can still be predicted by
sequence-to-function models.

Moving forward, a major bottleneck is the availability of uniformly processed and validated genomics data,
as well as high-quality QTL data for expression and other genomics data sets for less characterized cell
types. But even for well-studied cell types, identifying the key genes that affect the disease phenotype in
the presence of multiple regulatory variants and secondary transcription effects is challenging (Manolio et
al., 2009; Liu et al., 2019; Li and Ritchie, 2021). Models that predict the effect of multiple regulatory
variants and consider coding and non-coding epistasis in predicting disease outcomes would be useful
(Monti and Ohler, 2023). We note that while models are generally able to make accurate predictions for
unseen variants, it is nevertheless important to include more ancestry-diverse sequences during training
and to benchmark variants from the entire population so that all humans can maximally benefit in eventual
clinical applications (Martin et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2024). Finally, it will be critical to further develop and
apply more experimental techniques such as CRISPR editing to validate causal genetic variants (Z. Chen
et al., 2023; Pihlajamaa et al., 2023).

Filling the gap: 3D genome organization and long-range
regulatory interactions
One of the outstanding problems faced by gene expression models is to capture and integrate the effect
of multiple CREs, proximal and distal, on each gene. This is challenging because enhancers can act over
large genomic distances of over 1Mb to modulate the expression levels of their target genes (Chandra et
al., 2021; Long et al., 2020; Lettice et al., 2003). Since these regulatory connections are thought to
require physical proximity in 3D space, mapping the 3D organization of DNA in the context of chromatin
could detect important distal interactions and improve our ability to predict gene expression from DNA
sequence.

The 3D chromatin structure can be captured as genome-wide contact maps using Chromosome
Conformation Capture (3C) technologies such as Hi-C (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2014).
These methods can characterize multiple layers of genome organization, including cell-type-specific
aspects (Dekker et al., 2023). However, the limited resolution of Hi-C (typically 5kb-40kb) and the
requirement for very high sequencing coverage (e.g. 1 billion for 5 kb resolution) coupled with
underrepresentation of distal interactions make it challenging to assign enhancers to target genes. This
led to the development of additional steps in the assay that increase the coverage of the relevant regions
(Mumbach et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2016; Mifsud et al., 2015; Fullwood et al., 2009) or increase the
resolution by which contacts are detected. For example, Micro-C can achieve kilobase resolution
genome-wide (Hsieh et al., 2015; Krietenstein et al., 2020; Harris et al., 2023) or sub-kilobase resolution
for targeted regions (Goel et al., 2023). High-resolution contact maps in primary cell types have helped
predict target genes for distally located disease-associated genetic variants (Chandra et al., 2021;
Hamley et al., 2023; Javierre et al., 2016). However, they are difficult to obtain for a large collection of
primary cell types, and the genome-wide resolution is still not at the level of individual CREs to obtain
generalizable insights into enhancer-promoter interactions.

Computational methods that detect patterns in these contact maps have revealed multiple levels of
organization that could influence gene expression: chromatin compartments, topologically associating
domains (TADs), and chromatin interactions or loops (Zhang et al., 2024). Multi-megabase chromatin
compartments correspond to the large-scale division between transcriptionally active euchromatin (A
compartment) and inactive heterochromatin (B compartment). TADs spanning 100kb-1Mb regions are
often considered as regulatory units of coordinated gene expression within which CREs interact more
frequently with one another (Beagan and Phillips-Cremins, 2020). Two convergent CTCF motifs, which
stop cohesin-mediated loop extrusion (Fudenberg et al., 2016), often demarcate their boundaries.
Another pattern are preferential interactions among CREs, whether it is mediated by loop extrusion to
specifically bring two distal CREs in close proximity (e.g., chromatin loop between an enhancer and a
promoter) or broader colocalization of CREs in the 3D space potentially through their homotypic
interactions.

With the increasing resolution of contact maps, recent methods have detected additional patterns that
provide insights into how CREs influence loop extrusion and, in turn, gene expression (Vian et al., 2018;
Yoon et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022). For instance, stripes form when a loop anchor interacts with a long
stretch of chromatin at high frequency (Yoon et al., 2022). Stripe anchors generally mark clusters of
enhancers that regulate multiple genes throughout the domain (Vian et al., 2018), e.g. at immunoglobulin
loci (Hu et al., 2023; Vian et al., 2018) or developmentally regulated genes (Kraft et al., 2019). However,
how these emerging contact patterns can be generalized to model gene regulation is not yet clear.

To understand how 3D genome organization is instructed by DNA sequence, sequence-to-function
models have been trained to predict Hi-C contact maps (Zhang et al., 2024; Zhou, 2022; Fudenberg et al.,
2020; Schwessinger et al., 2020). Interpretation of these models suggests that the backbone of 3D
organization is established by motifs of architectural proteins such as CTCF and tends to be cell-type
invariant (Piecyk et al., 2022). So far, these models have not provided novel sequence features that
promote specific enhancer-promoter interactions. It is possible that further improvements, e.g., using
chromatin accessibility and ChIP-seq data as additional input during training (Tan et al., 2023), better data
coverage and resolution, or more extensive model interpretation, could reveal cell-type-specific features
that help predict gene expression.

The role of chromatin contacts in determining the effect of an enhancer on gene expression has also
been analyzed more explicitly (Fulco et al., 2019). This led to the Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model, which
has been applied across a large collection of cell types to better link non-coding risk variants to disease
genes (Nasser et al., 2021). The ABC model assumes that the influence of an enhancer depends on its
activity multiplied by the intensity of contact with the promoter and that multiple enhancers contribute to
gene expression in an additive manner. This analysis demonstrated, in part, the utility of cell-type-specific
contact maps in determining functional enhancer-promoter interactions but also showed that genomic
distance is the strongest determinant of enhancer-promoter contacts and has a large effect on gene
expression levels. This distance dependence agrees with recent experimental data (Zuin et al., 2022).

While the ABC model serves as a good baseline model, it cannot predict the effect of some validated
enhancers, suggesting that additional unknown mechanisms are at play. For example, closely spaced
enhancers may function synergistically or redundantly, and specific promoters may not be as responsive
to enhancers (Liu et al., 2019; Gschwind et al., 2023). Most notably, it is unclear how some enhancers
can find their target genes with high specificity over hundreds of kilobases, while others cannot. Studies in
the fruit fly suggest a new class of CREs that enables enhancers to do so by mediating long-distance
chromatin interactions (Batut et al., 2022). Such “extender elements” have recently been identified in
mice: when located next to an enhancer, they allow the enhancer to regulate target genes over hundreds
of kilobases of distance (Bower et al., 2024).

Taken together, these results suggest that enhancer-promoter interactions are a complex layer of the
cis-regulatory code. Enhancer-promoter interactions depend on genomic distance, the 3D organization
created by architectural CREs, and long-range contacts enabled by newly emerging CREs. Predictive
features might be identified and characterized more precisely by additional experimental efforts, including
generating high-resolution contact maps for more cell types, devising experimental techniques with
improved temporal and spatial resolution (“4D” (Sekelja et al., 2016; Dekker et al., 2023), measuring
multiple modalities such as chromatin organization and gene expression simultaneously (Zhou et al.,
2024; Liu et al., 2021, 2023; Su et al., 2020), as well as mapping multi-way contact of chromatin
(Quinodoz et al., 2018; Beagrie et al., 2017; A. S. Deshpande et al., 2022; Tavares-Cadete et al., 2020;
Oudelaar et al., 2022; L.-F. Chen et al., 2023). Significant computational innovation will be required to
leverage these additional data to extract sequence features that are currently missing or create models
that successfully learn long-distance interactions and the interplay of multiple CREs in gene regulation.

Assembling the parts: gene regulatory networks
Ultimately, cis-regulatory sequences are not only key for predicting expression levels, but also how cells
change their gene expression program dynamically during embryonic development, exposure to stress, or
disease pathogenesis. The methods described so far aimed to predict gene expression given a fixed
steady-state cellular state defined by a specific set of active TFs. To predict how cells change their gene
expression program, we need to understand how TF activities change over time. The activity of some TFs
is regulated by signal transduction pathways in response to extracellular stimuli. However, most TFs, and
the regulators they depend upon, are, to some extent, regulated at the expression level. Thus, TF
activities are themselves the target of CRE regulation, which creates a dynamic system that allows cells
to transition along specific cellular trajectories depending on their extracellular environment. The changing
interactions between TFs, CRE activity, and the expression of target genes over time are called gene
regulatory networks (GRNs).

GRNs play an important role during embryonic development, where cells transition through multiple states
to eventually acquire a specific cell fate with a characteristic cell-type-specific expression program.
Indeed, the concept of GRNs was pioneered in sea urchin and Drosophila embryos by studying how key
regulators identified through developmental genetics are themselves regulated (Levine and Davidson,
2005). This led to the discovery of enhancers, which each drive the expression of the target gene in a
specific spatio-temporal manner and are controlled by the combinatorial input from TFs active at that time.
By tracing back how these TFs are regulated, coherent descriptions of developmental processes were
obtained. However, such top-down models were restricted to key enhancers and TFs, required a
laborious iterative experimental process, and the identified cis-regulatory sequence rules did not
generalize to allow genome-wide predictions of gene expression from sequence alone.

Methods aimed at building GRNs from genome-wide data by explicitly modeling sequence motifs and
their TFs as regulators are called cis-GRN methods. These methods model gene expression over time or
across cell types as a function of TF motifs found in candidate CRE regions, identified by histone marks,
chromatin accessibility, or TF ChIP-seq data taken from developmental model systems (González et al.,
2015; Ding, Hagood, et al., 2018; Siahpirani et al., 2022). The initial candidate TF motifs are typically
identified by scanning CREs with a library of known motifs (Sherwood et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017;
Bentsen et al., 2020) or by de novo motif finding (Setty and Leslie, 2015). Relevant TF motif features are
then discovered through their association with co-regulated target genes or modules. A drawback of this
modeling approach is that it strongly depends on the choice of candidate CRE regions, TF motifs, and
target gene modules. Initial methods have focused on proximal enhancers near promoters, but recent
approaches also model or incorporate distal enhancers, either by their high accessibility when the target
is active (e.g. (Bravo González-Blas et al., 2023)) or by using 3C data (e.g., (Karbalayghareh et al.,
2022)). An advantage of cis-GRN methods is that CREs and the TF motifs involved in a particular process
can be identified de novo and followed up with experiments.

An alternative set of approaches for building GRNs are trans-GRN methods, which infer the role of TFs
and other “trans” regulators through their co-expression with their target genes (Amit et al., 2011; Kim et
al., 2009). These methods require large sample sizes and use probabilistic graphical models such as
Bayesian networks and their extensions (Friedman et al., 2000; Segal et al., 2003) or dependency
networks with linear (Greenfield et al., 2013; Siahpirani and Roy, 2017) or non-linear regression models
(Huynh-Thu et al., 2010; Baran et al., 2012). Several of these methods have integrated known TF motifs
located near promoters as secondary features to inform the network structure (Greenfield et al., 2013;
Siahpirani and Roy, 2017; Petralia et al., 2015; Glass et al., 2013). TF motifs can also inform TF activity
levels when the expression levels are a poor predictor of its activity, e.g., because the TF is regulated by
signaling (Miraldi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018).

The rise in single-cell genomics technology has greatly benefitted GRN inference, especially trans-GRNs,
which can leverage the large amounts of single-cell expression experiments (i.e., scRNA-seq) from
normal and disease conditions. Single-cell resolution data better distinguish cell types and states among
heterogeneous biological samples, thereby improving the discovery of the TFs that define each cell type.
The larger sample sizes also allow for capturing additional non-linearities between TF and target
expression with the help of deep learning models (Shu et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022). Furthermore,
cellular dynamics can be inferred using measured time (e.g. (Ding, Aronow, et al., 2018)), velocity (Bocci
et al., 2022; Burdziak et al., 2023), or pseudotime (L. Wang et al., 2023; J. Kim et al., 2021; A.
Deshpande et al., 2022), which can be used to inform GRN inference algorithms to capture fine-grained
dynamics. These inferred networks can be analyzed to identify regulators that may mediate the transition

Additional power for both cis and trans-GRNs comes from the combination of scRNA-seq with single-cell
ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data, ideally from a multi-omics assay where these data modalities are
measured simultaneously in the same cells (Badia-I-Mompel et al., 2023). Single-cell chromatin
accessibility data improve the quality of the inferred networks, resolution of cell types and allows the
analysis of TF motifs within CREs (L. Wang et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Bravo González-Blas et al.,
2023). Especially for cis-GRNs, cell-type-specific accessibility changes enable the prediction of
long-range enhancer-promoter interactions without requiring Hi-C experiments (Pliner et al., 2018;
Sakaue et al., 2024; Mitra et al., 2024).

Through such recent advances, trans-GRN and cis-GRN approaches are increasingly being combined,
but current approaches still primarily leverage one approach and are limited in the information they
capture. For trans-GRN methods, CREs and their sequence information are a secondary feature, which
limits their ability to predict the effect of genetic variation and reveal the molecular underpinnings of the
cis-regulatory code. But without the “trans” information, cis-GRNs cannot directly infer which TFs and
additional cell-type-specific regulators shape the TF activities that regulate the identified TF motifs.
Furthermore, both approaches typically lack the TF motif interaction rules and predictive accuracy that
sequence-to-function models provide. Combining different approaches in a more seamless way could
therefore enable an improved understanding of the cis-regulatory code.

A hurdle towards this goal is the benchmarking of cell-type-specific GRN models beyond well-studied
systems. For example, comprehensive gold standards are lacking when studying human cell types not
covered by ENCODE (Pratapa et al., 2020; McCalla et al., 2023; Chen and Mar, 2018). To confirm the
identity of a regulator and establish a relationship with target genes as causal therefore requires
experimental perturbations (Seçilmiş et al., 2022; Choo et al., 2024). Since such follow-up experiments
can be time-consuming, the availability of high-throughput perturbation screens that measure scRNA-seq
in response to various regulator perturbations in individual cells (Dixit et al., 2016; Replogle et al., 2022;
Schraivogel et al., 2023) would accelerate this validation step. Such data could also improve the models,
including their ability to predict how perturbations disrupt cellular function. Finally, centralized repositories
of datasets and methods (Ben Guebila et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023; Chevalley et al., 2023) will be useful
to advance methodological development and assess their practical utility for inferring the cis-regulatory
code.

Multi-scale integration: spatial transcriptomics and beyond
As we improve our ability to integrate different data modalities into coherent computational frameworks,
an exciting new frontier will be the integration of data across multiple scales, from molecule to cell to
tissue and organs. A particularly interesting aspect of such multi-scale integration is the spatial
organization of cells, which determines which signals a cell receives from its neighboring cells, an
element of GRNs that can currently only be inferred indirectly. Spatial aspects of gene regulation have
long been studied at a small scale during embryonic development (Dubuis et al., 2013) and are
particularly relevant in the brain (Piwecka et al., 2023). Such spatial organization can now be captured in

a high-throughput manner for virtually any tissue using recently developed spatial transcriptomics
technologies.

Spatial transcriptomics quantifies the expression distributions of large numbers of genes in a tissue at the
resolution of single (or few) cells or individual transcripts (Moses and Pachter, 2022). These technologies
rely either on sequencing with spatial barcoding (A. Chen et al., 2022; Rodriques et al., 2019) or
single-molecule-fluorescent in situ hybridization (Chen et al., 2015; Lubeck et al., 2014). All methods aim
to provide a comprehensive description of gene expression patterns across cells and tissues, without
requiring prior hypotheses on which genes might be differentially expressed. However, current methods
have limitations and represent different tradeoffs between the number of genes measured, spatial
resolution, and tissue area coverage (Moses and Pachter, 2022).

While these methods are still in their infancy, they have created new opportunities for developing
analytical tools that can extract different types of biological patterns. Such computational tools are
capable of (1) identifying genes that exhibit interesting spatial patterns (Svensson et al., 2018), (2)
distilling a large number of spatial expression patterns into a smaller, representative set of patterns
(Townes and Engelhardt, 2023), (3) inferring prominent spatial regions in the tissue (Hu et al., 2021; Dong
and Zhang, 2022), (4) characterizing cell-cell interactions in terms of involved cell types or genes (Arnol et
al., 2019; Dries et al., 2021; Cang et al., 2023), (5) identifying gene-gene interactions, e.g.,
ligand-receptor pairs, related to spatial expression (Yuan and Bar-Joseph, 2020; Tanevski et al., 2022),
and (6) detecting transcript localization (Xia et al., 2019; Mah et al., 2024) or transcript co-localization
(Kumar et al., 2024) at subcellular resolution. With these promising developments, it will be important to
systematically evaluate and benchmark these tools (Moses and Pachter, 2022).

Spatial transcriptomics promises to provide novel insights into how the cellular dynamics and organization
of tissues influence chromatin organization and gene regulation, but their potential has so far remained
largely untapped. Glimpses into what is possible can be seen in some existing approaches, e.g., those for
detecting cell-cell communication while incorporating signaling and regulatory networks (Browaeys et al.,
2020) or identifying tissue-level variations in RNA localization events that hint at post-transcriptional
regulatory processes (Kumar et al., 2024).

In the future, integrating spatial transcriptomics with additional data could improve the identification of
signaling events and their impact on gene regulation in specific tissues and cell types. For example,
combining spatial transcriptomics with spatial chromatin accessibility assays (Lu et al., 2022) could help
understand gene regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, tools for mapping non-spatial single-cell data to
spatial data from the same tissue (Biancalani et al., 2021) could be highly informative, as they can lead to
a common analytical framework for analyzing different single-cell measurements, e.g., transcripts and
chromatin accessibility (Fang et al., 2021), contact maps (Rappoport et al., 2023), and proteomics
(Bennett et al., 2023).

Future outlook for deciphering the cis-regulatory code
While there is rapid progress, major bottlenecks still exist in four areas. (1) There are clear gaps in our
mechanistic understanding of the cis-regulatory code (Figure 1, blue). (2) We need experimental data for
more cell types and more comprehensive multiomic data sets, including perturbation experiments, to
better model all steps of the cis-regulatory code (Figure 1, yellow). (3) We need better GRN methods that
more seamlessly combine cis-GRN, trans-GRN, and sequence-to-function approaches to model cell state

changes (Figure 1, green). (4) We need major advances in sequence-to-function models that leverage the
innovations above into more integrated and generalizable frameworks (Figure 1, pink).

Since we have an incomplete mechanistic understanding of how the cis-regulatory code is executed from
sequence all the way to gene expression, it is currently difficult to pinpoint which regulatory steps are not
well captured by current sequence-to-function expression models. Most notably, it is unclear how multiple
enhancers activate specific target genes, which could depend on their biochemical activities, chromatin
environment, relative distances, 3D organization, and other nearby CREs. Approaches that integrate 3C
data, single-cell multiomic data, single-molecule footprinting, and perturbation experiments could provide
the much-needed insights. The steps before, the local activities produced by TFs at enhancers, leading to
chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and other activating or repressing biochemical properties,
are also not well understood. Deciphering the steps and general mechanistic principles will require an
iterative process of model interpretation and experimental testing. Altogether, the mechanistic insights will
help benchmark current models and enable more focused efforts to improve them.

Another challenge will be to predict gene expression across a much larger number of cell types. Each cell
type has a unique combination and TF activities, and the exact sequence rules by which the TFs read out
CREs cannot easily be predicted based on the TFs’ individual binding specificities (Jolma et al., 2015)
and will require more high-resolution in vivo TF binding data, perhaps by adopting large-scale approaches
(Perez et al., 2023). Increasing the experimental coverage to hard-to-access cell types and conditions
during developmental processes and in heterogeneous adult tissues will likely occur through more
general methods such as single-cell multiomics data. While some missing data can be imputed when
appropriate training data exist (Ernst and Kellis, 2015; Schreiber et al., 2020), very unique combinatorial
TF binding specificities are difficult to discover without sufficient experimental data.

One way to obtain missing cis-regulatory sequence information without experimental data is to directly
leverage the large number of sequenced genomes across species. The specific combinations of TFs that
specify a cell type tend to be evolutionarily conserved (Tarashansky et al., 2021; Kuderna et al., 2024),
allowing CREs to be studied across evolution with sequence-to-function models (Kaplow et al., 2023;
Minnoye et al., 2020). Furthermore, DNA large language models trained to predict masked genome
sequences may detect combinatorial TF motif patterns in some cases (Karollus et al., 2024; Silva et al.,
2024) but currently struggle to learn this information when trained on genome-wide mammalian sequence
data (Tang and Koo, 2024). Future models trained more specifically on cis-regulatory regions could
capture combinatorial TF binding specificities and thus complement information learned from
sequence-to-function models.

Another important gap is GRN methods that more fully describe how cells dynamically change their TF
repertoire and gene expression program. The increasing number and quality of single-cell spatial and
temporal multiomics data create an opportunity to develop methods that better integrate cis-GRN,
trans-GRN and sequence-to-function approaches. This includes trans-GRN methods that link expression
programs to the cell-type-specific distal and proximal enhancers that regulate the genes (Mitra et al.,
2024; Sakaue et al., 2024), sequence-to-function models that identify the effect of TF motifs (D. S. Kim et
al., 2021; Bravo González-Blas et al., 2024), and cis-GRN methods that more explicitly identify which TF
might bind these motifs based on expression data (Yang and Pe’er, 2024). Such methods can describe
cellular changes across time and tissues and point to key TFs and CREs (Maslova et al., 2020; Janssens
et al., 2022; Özel et al., 2022).

As with sequence-to-function models, the insights obtained from modeling GRNs are however specific to
the system of interest. Although the principles should conceptually extend to other biological systems,
there is currently no generalizable framework that enables the effective prediction of expression changes
de novo, e.g., based on only TF activities or accessible CREs. Such domain adaptation will require
significant computational innovation. Intermediate steps towards this goal may involve developing
sequence-to-function methods that learn more directly how enhancers change their activities as a function
of changing TF activities.

In the long term, fully deciphering the cis-regulatory code will be important to predict how genetic variation
affects multi-scale behavior at the organismal, cellular and molecular level. We will need major
innovations in computational models to accurately predict cell-type-specific expression variation and the
effect of genetic variants. Knowledge about the mechanistic steps and structural constraints of the
cis-regulatory code could be introduced, for example, through geometric deep learning (H. Wang et al.,
2023; AlQuraishi and Sorger, 2021; Bronstein et al., 2021), while foundation models that can learn from
large amounts of non-coding genome sequences could improve generalization to new cell types and
systems (Szałata et al., 2024; Simon et al., 2024). Finally, it is expected that more experimental data,
including high-throughput perturbation screens, will increase the performance of models (de Boer and
Taipale, 2024). To enable such breakthroughs, having the best possible benchmarks in the form of
gold-standard data sets, and tools for mechanistic interpretation will be paramount.

Finally, having a strong community that promotes collaboration and communication will accelerate the
pace by which progress is made. For this reason, we, as authors, are part of the Regulatory and Systems
Genomics community of special interest (RegSys COSI), which organizes scientific sessions at the
annual ISMB meeting. We encourage more participation from people of all backgrounds and career
stages.

Figure 1. Regulatory genomics studies the intricate relationships between transcription factor activities
and target gene expression, mediated by cis-regulatory elements. Researchers seek to identify general
principles of gene regulation, such as how enhancer activities, motif syntax rules, 3D genome
organization and chromatin states relate to each other and ultimately to gene expression. A major goal is
to build accurate and generalizable sequence-function models that can not only reveal underlying
mechanisms but make predictions of variant effects. Another major theme is the reconstruction of gene
regulatory networks to describe biological processes of interest. Research into computational methods
and models in regulatory genomics strives to make best use of diverse and rapidly advancing
experimental technologies.
