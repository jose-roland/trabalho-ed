Abstract

Modeling and simulation approaches for infectious disease dynamics have
proven to be essential tools for effective control of the spread of epidemics in
the population. Among these approaches, it is obvious that compartmental
mathematical models, such as SIS, SIR, SEIR, etc. are the most widely used
by researchers. However, they are difficult to apply in a multi-scale environ-
ment, especially if we want to take into account the heterogeneous behaviors
of individuals. The aim of this paper is to present a hybrid model in which
an Equation-Based Model (EBM) of tuberculosis dynamics is coupled to an
Agent-Based Model (ABM) in a two-scale environment. In this model, indi-
viduals are placed in cities considered as agents in which the dynamics of the
disease is modeled by eight compartments and managed by solving a system
of differential equations. Individual agents move between these cities using an
ABM that controls their mobility. Considering some parametric values and
assumptions, the results obtained show that human mobility has a significant
impact on the spread of tuberculosis within the population. The manage-
ment of population and disease dynamics at different levels (microscopic and
macroscopic) testifies to the robustness of the proposed approach.

Health Organization’s (WHO) report [26]. An estimated 10.6 million people
fell ill with TB in 2021, up from 10.1 million in 2020, and 1.6 million people
died of TB in 2021. The incidence rate of tuberculosis increased by 3.6% in
2021 compared to 2020 [3]. This disease is spread mainly by air when in-
fected people cough or sneeze. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium
tuberculosis [26]. Poverty and rural exodus are key factors in the spread of
tuberculosis. Rural exodus, with migration to urban areas, often leads to
overcrowded neighborhoods with limited access to health services, and rural
migrants often work in precarious conditions without social protection, in-
creasing their risk of exposure to tuberculosis. Limited access to healthcare,
lack of diagnosis and treatment, and stigmatization are major obstacles in
the fight against tuberculosis.

The increase in the number of cases reported worldwide as reported in [3],
calls for an enhanced response in the fight against tuberculosis, which requires
in-depth scientific research. It is therefore imperative to develop mechanisms
for understanding the spread of this disease within the population at different
scales, using modeling and simulation approaches that take into account
population mobility.

In recent years, compartmental mathematical models such as SIS, SIR,
SEIR, etc. have been the most widely used to control and understand the
dynamics of infectious diseases in populations [1, 7, 10, 12, 19, 20, 25, 29, 31].
However, the concrete application of these models to environments that re-
quire the consideration of individual mobility is not easy. That’s why meta-
population models have emerged, they consider that populations of the same
species are spatially distributed and that there are more or less regular and
important exchanges of individuals between these populations [15]. The habi-
tat of this metapopulation is an ecological unit corresponding to the land-
scape, i.e. a set of sites with various stages of ecological succession and whose
geography allows limited gene exchanges but existing from one site to an-
other. In general, metapopulation processes emerge within a population of
individuals as a result of the spatial fragmentation of their habitat. These
models have increased their weakness with regard to the mobility compo-
nents. These limitations are treated in an aggregate manner, and therefore
do not consider the heterogeneous behaviors of individuals.

In the literature, several researchers have been interested in agent-based
models (ABM) derived from artificial intelligence to understand diseases
transmission in the population [8, 9, 11, 24]. With regard to the spread of
tuberculosis, these models have been applied in various research [17, 28, 30].

2



These models have made it possible to model interactions and contacts be-
tween individuals (infected or not) in order to take into account certain com-
plexities of social systems that deterministic models are unable to capture.
Drawing on the advantages of equation-based models on the one hand, and
agent-based models on the other, a number of researchers have demonstrated
the need to couple these two approaches [2, 19, 23]. These studies have
shown that coupling these approaches should facilitate understanding of the
dynamics of complex systems, and enable efficient calibration of parameters
at different levels.

This paper proposes a hybrid model in which a compartmental mathe-
matical model of tuberculosis is coupled to an agent-based model to analyze
the spread of the disease at different scales. Indeed, individuals are placed
in cities in which the dynamics of the disease is managed by solving the dif-
ferential equation system by the Runge-Kutta method and individuals move
between several cities over a circle using an agent-based model. Simulations
of the hybrid model proposed are performed and the impact of population
mobility on the spread of the disease is assessed.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We present the
description of the mathematical model (See Section 2), then we show the
description of the ABM using the Overview, Design concepts and Details
(ODD) protocol (See Section 3). Section 4 presents performed simulations
before discussing the results obtained in Section 5. Finally Section 6 is de-
voted to the concluding remarks.

2. Description of the Mathematical Model

We consider a compartmental model with 8 compartments (groups). In
the model we consider a population S that is susceptible to contract TB
infection. This population can be infected according to a contact rate α
and a transmission rate λ. For this, there is a proportion 1 − p of this
population that will be infected and therefore will be part of compartment
I, this is a fast progression to the active TB. We note that a susceptible
individual can become latent Le (latent early) following a contact rate α and
a transmission rate λ. In this model a latent individual (Le and Lf ) is not
yet able to transmit the disease. Latent individual Le can become Lf (latent
late) following a given rate h. A latent Le can also directly become infectious
(able to infect other people) at a rate q, an individual Lf can also become
infectious I at a rate w, this is the low progression to the active TB.

3



In this model, infected and infectious individuals, who are in the I, Le

and Lf compartments can heal spontaneously and move in the compartment
R2 according respectively to the rates σ, g2 and k2. They can also heal after
treatment process and move in the compartment R1 according respectively
to the rates γ, g1 and k1. These healed individuals can be re-infected accord-
ing to a rate of transmission λ, a contact rate α and a re-infection rate r.
Infectious people I, under treatment can also become Le according to a rate
r1. During the treatment process, there are people who are lost to follow
up, so people who stop treatment (K). These individuals can be re-infected
according to a rate r3. In the model, we consider other people who are trans-
ferred to other hospitals for lack of capacity or medication (T ). These people
can be re-infected at a rate r2.

Demography is considered in the TB proposed model. We note Λ the
rate of recruitment of susceptible individuals S. In the model people can
die, for that we consider µ1 as the rate of natural mortality (not related
to TB infection) and µ2 the rate of mortality linked to TB infection. The
Figure 1 below presents the TB transmission dynamics between the different
compartments of the model.

Based on presented information, we obtain the Ordinary Differential
Equation System Eq. (1).

The positivity of the solution, the existence and uniqueness of the solu-
tion, the calculation of equilibrium points (DFE and EE), the basic repro-
duction number R0 and the stability of the equilibrium points of this model
is presented in our recent work [22].

The dynamics of the disease at the level of all cities is managed by solving
the system of differential equations to control the dynamics of the disease.
This is the macroscopic level of the model. For individuals to move from city
to city, they are managed by a model based on intelligent agents that manages
each agent’s behaviors, including the probability of deciding to travel and
contamination during the trip. Once the individual arrives at his destination,
he contributes to the epidemiology of the disease in the city. This is the
microscopic level of the model. Note that at each simulation step, cities
generate individuals with their status according to a fixed rate (see Table 3).

3. Description of the ABM using ODD Protocol

To describe the agent-based model, we used the ODD (Overview, Design
concepts, and Details) protocol as a coherent, logical and readable account
of ABM structures and dynamics [14].

3.1. Overview

• Purpose: the purpose of the model was to assess the impact of popu-
lation mobility on the spread of TB in a multi-scale environment.

• Entities, state variables and scale: (1) Agent : in this model we consider
two types of agent. The first one is the individual. The second one is the
city. Indeed, an individual agent is located in a given agent city. Each
individual agent has state variables as well as characteristics presented
in Table 1. (2) Spatial Units : agent cities generate individual agents
according to a given rate of generation. An individual agents can move
from a city to others. State variables of cities are listed in Table 2.

• Environment : we assume that cities have the same population size.
Based on the geometry of the environment in Gama Platform [13], we
set the size of a city at 50× 50. The location of cities is a circle and is
calculated by the function presented by Eq. (2).

Key Components:

– i: The city number or identifier.

– s: The size of the city.

– c1: The length of the environment.

– c2: The width of the environment.

– b: The number of cities.

– f : A location function in a two-dimensional plane.

At each simulation time step, each city generates individual agents ac-
cording to their states (susceptible, early latent, late latent, infectious,
spontaneously recovered, recovered after treatment, transferred or lost
to follow- up). The generation rate of this population is given by the
variable z which is randomly selected between 0.001% and 1% closed
interval.

• Process overview and scheduling : the model process is in discrete time
steps representing 1 hour. At the beginning of the simulation, in cities,
individual agents are in any state. The disease dynamics is managed
by solving a differential equation system using RK4 method as applied
in [19]. Individual agents have a probability of leaving a city to another.
At each time step the sub-models are executed (movement, becoming
infected, healing, updating of global variables, etc.).

3.2. Design Concept

• Basic principle: the dynamics of TB is considered at two levels. (1) The
first one is in the city (macroscopic). Here, the spread of the disease
is based on mathematical model (Ordinary Differential Equation). For
that, eight compartments are considered (susceptible, early latent, late
latent, infectious, spontaneously recovered, recovered after treatment,
transferred and lost to follow-up). In this model, when a susceptible
individual comes into contact with an infectious individual, it is pos-
sible that the susceptible individual may become exposed or infectious
according to a rate of contact and a rate of transmission. People can
travel from their cities to others by choosing a random destination. (2)
The second one is the individual (microscopic). Here, once individu-
als travel from their hometown to another city, they are considered as
agents. Indeed, during the trip, the dynamics of the disease is managed
by an agent-based model.

• Emergence: the emergence of the system can be seen in the evolution
of TB infection in all cities considered. At the macroscopic level, it
depends on the contact rate and transmission rate between infectious
people and susceptible people. At the microscopic level, it depends on
the type of initially infectious agents, the other agents that come into
contact with them along a radius of contamination, the duration of
contact but also the frequency of contact.

• Adaptation: infectious agents can detect susceptible and cured agents.
Once cured agents detect infectious agents, these agents avoid contact
with them.

• Interaction: in this model we assume that agents within the same
radius interact with each other and also with their environment. For

8



example, if a susceptible agent is in a same radius as an infectious
agent, it is possible that the susceptible agent become contaminated.

• Stochasticity : The movement of the agents with their specific states
are stochastic. The choice of the destination city is random. Stochas-
ticity is also in the TB contamination as applied in [17]. During the
traveling, if a susceptible agent comes into contact with an infectious
agent, there is a certain probability that determines whether that agent
becomes exposed or directly infectious. In addition, the length of time
an agent remains in a state (susceptible, early latent, latent late, infec-
tious, spontaneously recovered, recovered after treatment, transferred
and lost to follow-up) is randomly chosen.

The probability of leaving one city A to another city B is calculated
by Eq. (3).

P (travel) = P (hAB) (3)

With A the source city and B the destination city, h a value between
0.1 and 0.9.

In this model, individual leaving his or her home city to a randomly
chosen destination city must pass through a central point of the cir-
cle called ”hub”. The mobility model of individuals on the transport
network is managed by an agent-based model.

• Observation: data are collected at each execution of the model on
individual agents according to their states (susceptible, early latent,
latent late, infectious, spontaneously recovered, recovered after treat-
ment, transferred and lost to follow-up). The output of the model is
collected at each time step to observe the evolution of infectious agents
over time.

3.3. Details

• Initialization: at the beginning of the simulation, a number of suscep-
tible individuals is placed in all cities and only one city has in addition
some infectious individuals.

• Sub-model:

9



– Clock : this sub-model manages time in the model. It is deter-
mined in hour, day, week, month and year. After every 24 hours,
the hour variable is reset to zero and the day variable is incre-
mented by 1. After every 7 days, the day variable is reset to zero
and the week variable is incremented by 1. After every 4 weeks,
the week variable is reset to zero and the month variable is incre-
mented by 1. After every 12 months, the month variable is reset
to zero and the year variable is incremented by 1. We therefore
assume a month to 4 weeks (28 days).

– Mobility : agents move from a city to another. The choice of des-
tination city is random. All information presented below is con-
sidered during the trip of the agent from a city to another.

– Contamination: at the microscopic level, contamination is based
on contact between a susceptible agent and an infectious agent,
and the probability of TB transmission. If a susceptible agent is
infected then he will change his status from susceptible to exposed
(Early latent (Le) / Late latent (Lf )) or infectious. At the macro-
scopic level, contamination is managed by the resolution of the
differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method
(RK4).

– Early latent : An exposed agent (Le) progresses to (Lf ) or to infec-
tious according to a certain probability of progression. The time
that the agent will remain in the state Le before moving to Lf is
determined by a certain probability as well.

– Late latent : an exposed agent (Lf ) progresses to infectious ac-
cording to a certain probability of progression. The length of time
the agent will remain in the (Lf ) state before becoming infectious
is also determined by a certain probability.

– Recover: infectious agents recover based on a probability of spon-
taneous recovery or a probability of recovery after taking medica-
tion.

– Relapse: cured agents may relapse and become exposed or infec-
tious based on a certain probability.

– Lost to follow-up: when an infectious agent stops taking medica-
tion before the end of treatment, it is considered lost to follow-up.

10



Infectious agents become lost to follow-up with a certain proba-
bility.

– Global variables update: all global variables are updated at the
end of each time step. At the same time also the number and
percentage of susceptible, exposed (Early latent and Latent late),
infected, transferred, lost to follow-up, Recovered (spontaneously
and after treatment) agents are all calculated.

4. Simulations of the Hybrid Model

To implement the resulting hybrid model, we used a special language
called GAML (GAma Modeling Language) provided by the GAMA platform,
which is an open source modeling and simulation environment for creating
spatially explicit agent-based simulations [13].

4.1. Parameters used in the Model

The Table 3 presents used parameters in performed simulations. Most of
them was taken from the literature. Other parameters was assumed based
on data at our disposal.

4.2. Numerical Simulation

To simulate this model we will consider the following case: First, we con-
sider 6 cities and a high mobility of people between those cities. Second, we
simulate the model by varying the mobility rate of individuals (low mobility
rate for infected and infectious individuals) between 6 cities.

This model is implemented using the GAMA platform which is a platform
designed for field experts, modelers and computer scientists. It is therefore
a complete modeling and simulation development environment for the con-
struction of spatially explicit multi-agent simulations. This platform was
designed completely in Java. As a free tool, GAMA uses the GAML (GAma
Modeling Language) for coding [13].

For all simulations, we consider that the disease exists in one of the cities
at the beginning of the simulation. This allows us to evaluate the impact of
population mobility on the disease dynamics (TB).

4.2.1. Simulation with a High Mobility Rate for all Individuals

By simulating the proposed model with the basic parameters shown in
Table 3. We consider the dynamics of TB which spreads globally over 6
connected cities with the mobility rate of all individual (S, Le, Lf , I, T,K,R1

and R2) equal to 0.01. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the model during
simulation.

The results obtained are shown in Figure 3 for all the cities (global) and
in Figure 4 for each city separately (one by one city):

4.3. Runtime Evaluation

In the modeling and simulation of infectious disease spread, combining
equation-based models and agent-based models allows for the creation of a
hybrid model that benefits from the advantages of both approaches. This
combination notably reduces execution time and decreases resource require-
ments, unlike a model entirely based on agents.

In Table 4, we present the execution time of the ABM [17], EBM [22], and
Hybrid model separately with different values for the susceptible individuals
(S). For the ABM, the mixed population structure is considered, while for

the hybrid model, the population structure is a network with three cities
connected via a central hub. The simulation concludes when the number of
individuals infected with tuberculosis (I) reaches zero ((I = 0)). This means
that the disease is eliminated in the population.

Based on the results presented in Table 4, we present in Figure 8, the
evolution of the runtime of each model according to the number of the sus-
ceptible individuals.

An overall comparison of the execution times of these models shows that
the hybrid model reduces the execution time by around 17.86% compared

ferent scales. Agent-based models make it possible to simulate complex in-
teractions between individuals, which are difficult to capture with differential

equations alone. For example, the spread of a disease may depend on a vari-
ety of individual behaviors and specific social contacts. Differential equations
are effective for modeling large-scale dynamics, such as the global spread of
an epidemic. In contrast, agent-based models can simulate small-scale dy-
namics, such as interactions within a community. It should be noted that
agent-based models can be easily adapted to include new behaviors or agents,
while differential equations offer a rigorous mathematical structure for an-
alyzing global trends. On the basis of the motivations set out above and
the evidence presented in the Table 5, it appears that coupling these two
approaches has many advantages.

To demonstrate the robustness of our approach, including the advan-
tages of combining the agent-based model with the equation-based model, we
present in Table 6 a comparative study with various compartmental, agent-
based, and hybrid models found in the literature.

In this comparative study, we highlight the objectives pursued by the
different authors and highlight several aspects such as stochasticity (yes/no),
multi-scale environment (yes/no), runtime (Very low/Low/High) and the
limitations of each model.

5. Discussion of the Results and Recommendations

5.1. General Discussion

The hybrid model implemented and simulated shows that individual mo-
bility has an impact on the spread of tuberculosis in the population. Indeed,
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate that when there is a large number of people moving
from city to city (mobility rate equal to 0.01 of the population according
to its status), the disease spreads to all cities. This is justified by the fact
that infected persons moving from their home city to another city contribute
to the epidemiology of the destination city (randomly selected). The persis-
tence of tuberculosis in poor countries can be partially justified by the rural
migration. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, poor peo-
ple living in the provinces move to the capital (Kinshasa) to seek a better
life. Kinshasa being already one of the cities most affected by TB [4], the
arrival of new cases from other cities is one of the factors contributing to the
persistence of tuberculosis in this city.

By reducing the mobility rate to 0.00001 for people with TB infection and
people with latent TB, simulations show that the disease does not spread in
all cities as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. This means that restricting the mobility

(between cities) of infectious and latent people is one of the measures to be
taken to control the spread of tuberculosis across a country.

Based on the results obtained, it seems that the mobility of individuals
from city to city has a significant impact on the spread of tuberculosis in
the population. Indeed, when people move from one city to another, they
can carry tuberculosis bacteria with them, potentially spreading the infec-
tion to new areas. This is of particular concern in regions with high TB

EBM A mathematical compartmen-
tal model is proposed to un-
derstand the spread of TB, in-
cluding groups lost to follow-
up and those who have been

results indicate that treat-
ing latent TB infections and
managing population mobility
are crucial strategies that TB

sider to eliminate the disease
in the country.

No No Very
low

The mathematical model presented
here offers a comprehensive overview
of the spread of TB at a popula-
tion level. However, it does not
delve into the intricate interactions
between individuals, which can sig-
nificantly influence the dynamics of
disease transmission. By focusing on
a global perspective, the model over-
looks the heterogeneity in individ-
ual behaviors, contact patterns, and
the impact of localized interventions.
The model may not fully capture the
nuances required for targeted inter-
ventions and personalized treatment
plans.

[22]

EBM &
ABM

A hybrid model is proposed
for managing the spread of in-
fectious diseases. The pro-
posed model allows geographic
areas to switch between the
equation-based model and the
agent-based model depending
on the number of agents in-
fected in the environment.
The model was tested at the
town level and then at the
county level to compare the
time saved compared to a fully
agent-based model.

Yes Yes Low As the switch between ABM and
EBM depends on the number of in-
fected agents, if the number of these
agents is very low, the transition will
not take place at that time. In this
case, the hybrid model will not cap-
ture the heterogeneous behavior of
these agents, which could influence
and contribute to the dynamics of
the disease under consideration. In
addition, since the compartmental
model considered is of the simplistic
SEIR type, it is difficult to confirm
whether the amount of fidelity will
not be lost.

[16]

EBM &
ABM

The proposed model integrates
two modeling paradigms,
ABM and EBM, to create a
hybrid approach that opti-
mizes computational efficiency
under varying conditions.
Initially, the model operates
as agent-based, but it tran-
sitions to an equation-based
approach once the number of
infected individuals becomes
sufficiently large to justify a
population-averaged method.

Yes Yes Low As the model starts as agent-based
and switches to equation-based when
the number of infected individuals
is large, the run time should remain
high compared to other hybrid mod-
els if the ABM is complex. Addi-
tionally, the presented example used
a simplified Agent-Based Model and
does not account for behavior change
during an epidemic.

[6]

EBM &
ABM

In this model we propose a hy-
brid model that combines an
EBM with an ABM at differ-
ent scales. This approach al-
lows us to capture both the
broad trends and detailed in-
teractions within the popula-
tion. By simulating individ-
ual movements and behaviors,
the model provide insights into
how mobility influences TB
transmission in a multi-scale
environment.

Yes Yes Low The mathematical model employs
eight compartments to analyze TB
dynamics at the population level,
which adds to its complexity. Ad-
ditionally, the proposed experimen-
tal model does not utilize real-world
data.

prevalence, or where health systems are not well coordinated. Short-term
mobility between different areas can lead to an increase in TB prevalence, as
individuals can move from a high-risk to a low-risk area, potentially intro-
ducing new infections. In addition, mobility can disrupt continuity of care
for those undergoing TB treatment, leading to poorer health outcomes. TB
control efforts need to take account of these mobility patterns in order to
effectively manage and reduce the spread of the disease.

Improving the living conditions of the population in the provinces and
decentralizing TB care center can be a palliative solution to the rural migra-
tion. With this strategy, people can simply stay in their home cities because
the living and care conditions are the same as in other cities.

5.2. Benchmarking Discussion

Simulation results show that our approach is a compromise that benefits
from the advantages of both ABM and EBM. Table 4 and Figure 8 show
that the proposed hybrid model reduces the execution time compared with
the ABM model.

Based on the comparative study presented in Table 6, it appears that
the combination of these two types of modeling offers a more complete and
nuanced understanding of the spread of tuberculosis in a highly mobile pop-
ulation and in a multi-scale environment. Comparing our approach with
compartmental models, it seems that mathematical modeling offers only a
global view of disease spread (macroscopic), without highlighting the inter-
actions between individuals infected or not with tuberculosis (microscopic).
However, we have found that the execution time of these models remains
low. It should be noted that agent-based modeling has proven its perfor-
mance in modeling interactions between individuals, taking into account the
multi-scale environment and also stochasticity. On the other hand, these
models require several parameters and their execution time is high compared
with a hybrid model.

This innovative approach is a powerful tool that enables managers to
develop effective control strategies in multi-scale environments.

5.3. Recommendation for Managing Population Mobility in Low and Middle
Income Countries with High TB Prevalence

According to the results of our study, managing the mobility of people
in a country with a high prevalence of tuberculosis is an important task for
public health decision-makers. As rural exodus is a specific form of mobility,

22



it is important to understand its causes, as it promotes the spread of the
disease.

Since many factors associated with poverty increase the risk of tuber-
culosis propagation, in developing countries, poverty and lack of economic
opportunity drive people to seek better living conditions in cities. This leads
to high human mobility and facilitate the spread of tuberculosis on a large
scale. Limited access to basic services is another cause of high population
mobility from villages to cities. Indeed, the lack of essential infrastructures
such as drinking water, electricity and healthcare encourages rural popula-
tions to migrate to the cities. It has also been observed that armed conflicts
and insecurity in certain rural areas force inhabitants to flee to safer areas,
bringing disease germs with them to the developed cities and thus contribut-
ing to the prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in these cities.

To effectively manage the mobility of people caused by the above-mentioned
problems, governments can consider a number of solutions, including:

• Investing in basic infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals) to enhance
the quality of life in rural areas;

• Promoting local initiatives and economic development projects to cre-
ate jobs in rural areas;

• Introduce sustainable farming techniques and climate-resistant crops
to boost agricultural productivity;

• Implement measures to guarantee the security of rural populations and
reduce conflict.

The fight against poverty is therefore essential to reduce the spread of
tuberculosis and enhance health outcomes in affected communities. It is
therefore essential to enhance access to healthcare for migrant populations,
and to implement tuberculosis awareness and prevention programs.

6. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we presented a model of tuberculosis spread and simu-
lated it on an environment composed of several cities and having a central
point as a mandatory passage for the choice of the destination city for trav-
ellers. The disease dynamics at the level of each city was represented by an

23



8-compartment model that manages the spread of TB by solving an ordinary
differential equation using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. To ensure
the mobility of people from city to city, individuals and cities have been con-
sidered as intelligent agents. At each time step, cities generated individuals
who had to travel from one city to another randomly selected according to a
mobility rate. The implemented model is called hybrid because it couples the
differential equations applied in each city to the intelligent agents that act on
the individual by considering his heterogeneous behaviors such as mobility,
random choice of destination (decision making), change of status (interaction
with other agents), etc. This model benefits from the advantages of these
two modeling-simulation approaches for complex systems. The model imple-
mented here has the advantage of not requiring a large number of parameters
and a high capacity in terms of machine power. In addition to the advantage
of being synthetic, this hybrid model benefits from the analytical charac-
ter of mathematical models. Agent-based modeling enriches this model by
imposing a stochastic character on it through random facts introduced into
the random choice of the destination city for individuals but also into the
generation of individuals in different cities at a randomly chosen rate.

The consideration of the individual as an entity in its own right and
the management of his or her behaviour gives the microscopic aspect to the
model set up and brings it as close as possible to reality. The mathematical
management of the spread of the disease in cities gives a macroscopic aspect
to the model. This model therefore draws its richness from this dynamic
at two different scales, which gives the emergence of the model at the global
level. As a result, it seems obvious that the coupling of mathematical models
to agent-based models will be applied when the dynamics of the complex
system under consideration is at different scales. The implemented hybrid
model does not require enough computing power compared to the general
agent-based model which requires high performance simulation hardware.
The results obtained show that coupling the EBM and ABM approaches is
an interesting compromise, as confirmed by our latest work described in [21].

As part of the outlook, we intend to adjust the proposed model and
proceed with several applications:

• Use real tuberculosis data to compare the results obtained with those
of simulated data. This should help us validate the proposed model;

• Replace the ordinary differential equations used in the hybrid model
with stochastic equations, which should make it possible to introduce

24



randomness at all levels of population and disease dynamics, making
the proposed model even more realistic;

• Integrate the TB vaccination at the microscopic level of this model.
This should make it possible to see its impact at the global level of the
model.

Finally, we believe that the hybrid approach presented in this paper is
versatile and can be applied to understand the dynamics of other diseases
without requiring significant modifications.
