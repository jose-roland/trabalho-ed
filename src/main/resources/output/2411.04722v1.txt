An Approach for Molecular and Biological Characterizations of

Virulent Influenza A Viruses

Meitner Cadena and Alejandro Yerovi

November 8, 2024

Abstract

We propose an approach based on a combination of physical, chemical, and mathe-

matical methods to identify and characterize virulent influenza A viruses (IAVs) through

the analysis of the hemagglutinin protein. These methods include the isoelectric point,

extreme value theory, and tree-like classification. The characterization process involves

molecular and biological aspects. This procedure was applied to an IAV sample that

included strains related to known influenza pandemics. The results provided clear posi-

tion and amino acid pairs that identify these virulent viruses. These results show that

our approach is promising to contribute new methodologies to identify and characterize

virulent IAVs.

Keywords: influenza A virus, hemagglutinin, pH, isoelectric point, extreme value theory,

tree-like classification

1 Introduction

It is well-known that the pH influences virus activity, when mainly this parameter decreases.

These interactions should be quite precise, since too low a pH can produce a temporal irre-

versible conformational change in the influenza A virus (Stegmann et al., 1987). Still, this

modification can become permanent if exposure to low pH was for prolonged periods, leaving

the virus inactive thereafter. Viral proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix protein

1 undergo structural changes due to low pH to facilitate the viral infection process. This

form of activation is usually achieved when the virus reaches the endosomes inside the host

cells (Moreira et al., n.d.). Precisely, the acidic character of these large protein complexes

contributes to said activation of the virus.

In normal environments, the virus cannot maintain a low pH because it risks becoming

unstable. However, some forms of this virus have shown to hold lower pH levels than usual

in normal conditions. This ability would confer to these variants more stability in acidic

environments as those of endosomes, which has been linked to increase their infectivity,

pathogenicity, and transmissibility. In effect, in vitro experiments have shown that HA that

has pH stability provides the virus with more efficiency for its replication (Singanayagam et

al., 2019). We took advantage of this observation to formulate a systematic quantification

of the pH of HA proteins using isoelectric point analysis, extreme value theory, and a novel

hierarchical classification that guides the linkage of amino acid traits to virulence.

In practice, several procedures have been implemented to determine the virulence of influenza

A viruses. In this way, protection mechanisms would be established aimed at at least avoiding

variants of these viruses that could lead to serious situations such as pandemics. These

procedures are based mainly on laboratory tests and assays that attempt to detect variants

that present a high risk of virulence, as the molecular configurations necessary to produce

these risk levels are unknown (Tscherne et al., 2011). For example, it involves identifying

variants that produce changes that alter the entry of viruses as well as their binding to host

cells (Liang, 2023), changes in the activity of the virus polymerase (Tscherne et al., 2011)

and mediations to reduce the host’s immune response (Kobasa et al., 2004). However, these

laboratory studies are limited due to the availability of resources and execution time. That

is, these analyzes are reduced to a few global assessments.

In this article, we propose a different approach to assess virulence. This procedure is practical

since only HA sequences are used. Additionally, a molecular characterization of high-risk

virulence is provided by analyzing historically observed patterns of influenza A pandemics.

It is based on the identification of extreme pH values of HA proteins that would be related

2



to high virulence, where said pH values are obtained through the notion of isoelectric point.

In this way, molecular characterizations of HA proteins having extreme pH values can be

obtained using classification-like trees.

The following section describes the data and analysis procedures used to identify virulent

influenza A viruses and characterize them molecularly and biologically. The results of the

application of the proposed analysis method are presented in Section 3. Section 4 then

discusses these results with respect to the molecular and biological characteristics of virulent

influenza A viruses. The final section present concluding comments on this research.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Data

All hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of influenza A viruses (IAVs) that infected humans and

whose sequences were reported to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

until July 31, 2024 were considered. The main possible subtypes of influenza A HnNm that

affect humans were included, say H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 and H5N1 (Mifsud et al., 2022). From

these HA proteins, the ones that had a partial coding sequence, more than one stop codon

or without their year of registration were discarded. Additionally, only sequences that had

the most common nucleotide length (566) were selected. This gave 30,314 HA proteins.

2.2 Analysis Techniques

2.2.1 Isoelectric Point

To consider the pH of each HA protein, the isoelectric point (pI) of a molecule was used. This

kind of point represents the pH of this molecule when it is electrically neutral (Cleaves, 2011).

This notion has key applications as purification of proteins through their separation (Kos-

mulski, 2016), prediction of protein behavior through protein features as solubility, stability,

and activity (Pergande & Cologna, 2017), removal of viruses from monoclonal antibodies

3



through anion exchange chromatography (Leisi et al., 2021), and protein extraction through

isoelectric point precipitation (Yao et al., 2023). The HA proteins were then assigned their

isoelectric point calculated from their amino acid sequences using the computePI function

of the seqinr (Charif & Lobry, 2007) library of the R programming environment (R Core

Team, 2021). This function calculates the theoretical pI based on the pK values of the amino

acids reported in (Bjellqvist et al., 1993, 1994). More precisely, each amino acid has ioniz-

able carboxylate and ammonium groups corresponding to the carboxyl and amino groups,

respectively. This produces the following acidity and basicity concentration relationships:

Ka =
[H+] [COO−]

[COOH]
and Kb =

[OH−] [NH+
3 ]

[NH2]
,

where [X] indicates the concentration of X, COOH is the carboxylic acid or carboxyl group and

NH2 is the amino group. These concentrations show the dissociation levels of the molecules

considered. For instance, if COOH tends to dissociate easily, the values [H+] and [COO−]

will increase while [COOH] will decrease. Then, pI is defined by

pI =
pKa + pKb

2
, (1)

where pKa = − log10(Ka) and pKb = − log10(Kb).

This pI calculation has limitations. For example, post-translational modifications that could

alter the protein being analyzed, such as phosphorylation of glycosylation, are not considered

(Kozlowski, 2021), and possible interactions between residues are not observed, as they occur

during a folding process (Harms et al., 2009).

2.2.2 Thresholds For Extreme Values

A formidable and convenient fact for humans is that influenza A pandemics that have occurred

are very rare. Mathematically, this means that the events of this type of pandemic are

susceptible to being analyzed using the Theory of Extreme Values (Haan & Ferreira, 2006).

More precisely, our interest is to identify the extreme pH values of HA proteins in order to

4



characterize them. In this sense, the mean excess function e(x) of a random variable X can

be used to estimate from where the value x said function behaves as a constant when it is

assumed that X follows a generalized Pareto distribution GPD(ξ, β), 0 < ξ < 1 and β > 0,

for large values x. For this distribution, this function defined by e(x) = E(X − x|X > x),

where E(X) means the expected value of X or its mean, is, say e.g. (Ghosh & Resnick,

2010),

e(x) =
β + ξx

1− ξ
. (2)

Therefore, e(x) showing linearly increasing behaviors would suggest the presence of extreme

values. Then, the threshold from which this type of values would be presented would be the

smallest x value for which these unusual behaviors are evident. To determine the threshold

for extreme pH values, the mrlplotx function of the evmix package (Hu & Scarrott, 2018)

of the R programming language was used. In addition, since the objective extreme values

of pH are those that are low, the transformation exp(−pH× ln(10))× 1, 000, 000 to express

these extreme values as high values was applied.

2.3 Classification Trees

To molecularly and biologically characterize virulent IAV variants, an approach as classifi-

cation trees (Breiman et al., 1984) was applied. This non-linear, non-parametric technique

identifies values of certain variables that allow us to discriminate behaviors of a target vari-

able. This process uses an error function that measures how well such discrimination is

achieved. Fewer errors, better classification. As a result, the original data is split based on

the value and variable that produce the lowest error. This procedure is applied recursively

on each subset of data obtained from the set division described above. We propose a bit

different approach for targeting virulent IAVs. It consisted in to analyze sub-sequences of

HA proteins in order to determine the ones related to uniquely virulent IAVs. Note that

from these notable sub-sequences, their initial and final amino acids always facilitate the

distinction between virulent and non-virulent AIVs, but for other amino acids in these sub-

5



sequences their function is not delved into. Next, the positions that appear most frequently

were identified, as they would be key to identifying virulent IAVs.

Fig. 1 (A) shows a sample of amino acid sequences to illustrate how to find amino acids that

distinguish virulent sequences from those that do not using our classification procedure. This

example shows 5 virulent, denoted by vn with n from 1 to 5, and 9 non-virulent, denoted

by nvn with n from 1 to 9, HA protein sequences, which are supposed to have a length of

40. Amino acids that are not common in a given position are highlighted. Considering sub-

sequences of length 1, the amino acid N in position 2 allows the identification of virulent AIV

since no non-virulent sequence has that amino acid in position 2. Something similar happens

with Y in position 6, H in position 13, C in position 15, L and S in position 16, V in position 17,

K in position 31 and S in position 40. Considering sub-sequences of length 2, CL at position

15 is the only two-amino acid subsequence that allows the identification of a virulent AIV.

These amino acids of interest are summarized in Fig. 1 (B) using a sequence logo (Dong et

al., 2020) that was prepared using the logo tool available at weblogo.berkeley.edu (Crooks

et al., 2004). This drawing shows the virulence-relevant amino acids and their frequencies

that were identified for each position in a reference sequence.

3 Results

Fig. 2 plots the estimated pH of the analyzed HA proteins. These values appear more

frequently during the years after 2000 due to several key factors, such as advances in tech-

nology for high-throughput sequencing (Tsai & Chen, 2011), global health initiatives related

to influenza (Petrova & Russell, 2018), and epidemiological studies (Lavenu et al., 2006).

Furthermore, this figure shows that years with lower pH values would be related to IAV

pandemic years, for example, the years 1918 and 2009.

Fig. 3 presents (A) all these pH values together and (B) their transformed values. The last

values allow us to visualize how far the extreme values located on the right side are from the

common values located on the left side. Application of the function mrlplotx produced the

threshold 0.11639, which corresponds to pH 6.93407 (pH∗). Therefore, 1,666 of 30,314 HA

proteins were determined to be virulent (5.5 %).

Next, the set of all sequences was analyzed using the classification approach described above

to distinguish the ones with pH lower than pH∗ from those with higher pH. To this end,

application of our procedure to classify virulent HA proteins with sub-sequence lengths from

1 to 50 allowed the identification of 284 virulent IAVs. Fig. 4 (A) shows these results of

classification, where all ranges presented in this figure correspond to those identified virulent

IAVs. Fig. 4 (B) shows the coverage for those ranges that means how many ranges overlap

each position. Ranges and coverage were computed using the IRanges package (Pages et

al., 2013). This coverage curve allows the visualization of positions with higher frequencies

through all positions of analyzed HA proteins. This means that such positions are common

to a number of virulent IAVs, which would thus be associated with key positions that have

roles in virulence as they have relevant frequencies.

Table 3 shows that the modes involved are distributed throughout the HA protein. Among

their biological functions, antigenic sites stand out, suggesting that evasion of the host’s

immune system is an important component of the virulence strategy by lowering the pH.

Fig. 5 shows the possible virulence-related positions that were found (in yellow) in three-

dimensional representations of the HA protein. These graphs are based on the 1RUZ 1918

variant available in the Protein Data Base database (Berman et al., 2003) and to obtain these

graphs the VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) application has been used. These images show (A)

front, (B) side, and (C) top views of this protein.

Regarding the amino acids associated with ten positions with highest frequencies, Table 2

shows these results, which include the frequencies of the positions in question and also the

frequencies of the amino acids involved. The positions are sorted by decreasing frequency

and in ascending order by position if they match in frequency. The amino acids of each

position are arranged in descending order according to their frequency and alphabetically if

they coincide in frequency. These notable positions were highlighted in Table 3 in bold.

4 Discussion

Our main objective of knowing how virulent the structure of an IAV can be to plan prevention

measures against possible epidemics and pandemics has been met. Indeed, our approach

based mainly on the use of pH measurements, the application of extreme value theory and

the configuration of classification-like trees has allowed the identification of key positions in

HA proteins to describe their virulence. According to our approach, well-known pandemic

years appear to be related to virulent viruses collected in 1918 and 2009, but also potential

virulent IAVs would also have appeared in 1968, 1972, 2021, 2023 and 2024. Further, such

12



identification of those key positions has been determined using local modes because the high

frequency in a representative sample of virulent IAVs would mean that these positions play

a crucial role. Interestingly, these positions are distributed throughout the HA protein, but

some of them definitely seem very important. Furthermore, some of the specific amino acids

involved in these positions have been established.

The distribution of potential virulence-related positions in Table 3 and the position frequency

presented in Table 2 shows that virulent AIVs would be related to both HA1 and HA2, but

with more emphasis with HA1 than with HA2. This clarification between HA1 and HA2

seems not to be included in the scientific literature where what is considered is that both

HA1 and HA2 would play crucial roles in the virulence of IAVs (Shirvani et al., 2020). On

the other hand, considering the frequency of the biological functionalities of the potential

positions of greatest virulence, it is observed that the increase in the intervention of the

antigenic sites would be supported by the decrease in pH. This suggests that these positions

would have biological functions distinct from antigenic sites before mutations occur that

confer antigenic functions to these sites.

Also, it seems difficult to identify crucial positions related to virulence since this concept has

not been characterized in terms of positions. In this way, our model clearly contributes to

clarifying what these potential positions would be.

5 Conclusions

The uncertainty about how the HA protein of an IAV mutates represents a serious limitation

to knowing how virulent this virus can be. Despite this, it has been possible to identify

positions that would be playing a crucial role in the emergence of virulent IAVs. This analysis

based on the application of physical, chemical and mathematical processes thus seems to be

a promising strategy to complement the analyzes carried out to determine the virulence of

an AIV.

Moreover, although the characterization of the mutations has not been addressed in this study,

13



this essential knowledge could also be revealed by the procedure we have proposed. In fact,

the identification of potential positions with specific amino acids for obtaining virulent IAVs

would allow analyzing the relationships between virulent and non-virulent IAVs. Therefore,

some of these relationships could involve the aforementioned mutations.

As there is still a need to better understand the composition and function of structural and

antigenic integrity sites and even their evolution in positions and amino acids when virulent

IAVs are formed, further investigations are required. These activities that aim at acquiring

new knowledge may also include explorations on topics as Gibbs free energy and molecular

symmetry among others.
